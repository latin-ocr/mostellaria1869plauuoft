too confined. In 1819 a tract was published by Lingius, afterwards
Rector of the Gymnasium of Hirschberg‚ in Sssesia, entitled De Hialu
z‘n Versibus Plautinis, written with great good sense and moderatiori,
in which, after a careful examination, he endeavours to classify the
different examples of hiatus found in Plautus, and to distinguish
those which are common from those which are more rare, and to
specify cases in which, according to his views, hiatus is altogether
inadmissible. Although the limits which he assigns are so wide as
to comprehend a vast number of examples‚ and practically it will be
found very difficult, if not impossible, to fix upon any limits at all, yet
we shall have no difficulty in enumerating the different cases in which
the licence‚ if we can call it so, is most common, and in which there is
no reasonable ground for altering the text on this account alone.

1. Long Monosyllables. In these elision is freely neglected. The
long monosyllable may remain long, or may be shortened‚ as in the
familiar Virgilian lines,

Ecl. VIII. 108,
Credimus? au qu} amant ipsi sibi somnia fingunt.
Aen. VI. 507,
Nomen el arma locum servant, le, amia, nequivi.
Thus Most. Ι. i. 42, 71,
Si lzZ ΙΙ oles .· neque superior quam herus accumbere,
Molestus ne sis: nunc iam i rus, le ΙΙ amove.
Mil. 11. vi. 88,
lVae lu hercle, sile di ΙΙ amant, linguam comprimes.
Eun. V. viii. 50,
Neque isium meluas ne ΙΙ amet mulier: facile pellas, ubi velis.
Phorm. Prol. 27,
Quia primas parles qui ΙΙ aget, is eril Phormio.
Mil. IV. viii. 4,

P. Quid vis.) Pr. Quin (lu) iubes eeferrz' omnia quae Η isli dedi.

2. The Penthemimeral Caesam in Iambic Trimeters. Hiatus is
exceeding common in this place: thus Pseud. Ι. i. 24,

Interpretari ΙΙ alium posse neminem,
which is the reading of all the MSS„ including A.
Rud. Prol. 7,

Inler mortales ambulo ΙΙ interdius.
Most. Ι. i. 80,

Video corruptum Η ex adulescenle optutum·
so all the MSS. Stich. 111. ii. 7,
