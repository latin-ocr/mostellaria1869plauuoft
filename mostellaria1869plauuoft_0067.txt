ORTHOGRAPHY. xxxvii

worthless‚ because the writers would in most cases represent the
orthography prevalent in their own day.

Where the question arises as to the insertion or omission of an
aspirate at the beginning of a word, or between two vowels, we have
absolutely nothing to guide us, but in so far as Plautus is con-
cerned, we might be safe in omitting it after a mute, and in writing
Corz'ntus‚ Cartago, Anlz'ocus, Agatocles, BACANAE [10 quaterJ, Pulcer,
BRACIVM [12]‚ Arcileclus, sepulcrum, teatrum, lrz‘umpus ,· although
we could scarcely bring ourselves to adopt the form Pz'lipus‚ which
is found on a coin, especially as Philippus appears on other pieces
belonging apparently to the same epoch; and, generally speaking, in
proper names, and especially those of foreign origin and rare occur-
rence, we cannot look for accuracy‚ or adhere to Latin rules; and
hence we may retain the Greek spelling, and adopt Philolaches, Phile-
matium, and T heuropzdes‚ instead of Pilolaces, Pz'lematz'um‚ Teuropz'des.

In so far as the rule of Quintilian is concerned, it is closely
observed in inscriptions. We have indeed an aspirate before a
vowel at the commencement of a few words which discarded the
aspirate at a later period, such as HARENATO, n. 557, HOLI-
TOR, n. 1057, HERVCINA, n. 1495; on the other hand, it does
not appear in EREDES, n. 1034, OSTIA, n. 819, ARRESPEX,
n. 1348, ERCEISCVNDA [19 bz'sJ. The only violation of the
precept which forbids the use of the aspirate after a consonant, in
a word not a proper name, is SEPVLCHR(um) in n. 1107 (but
there is nothing to fix the date of this inscription with certainty), and
the proper name, PHISIDAE, which occurs in 18, B.C. 71, but
which is evidently a mere blunder‚ since the word (PISIDAE)
appears in its correct form repeatedly in the same inscription.
PVLCHER‚ as a proper name, appears on a Denarius minted in
all probability towards the close of the Republic, on some coins
struck in Asia, and on a fragment of sculpture found at Eleusis.

Q.

Although q was never extensively employed by the Romans, it
certainly was employed commonly, at an early period, in certain
words in which it was afterwards supplanted by c. Foremost among
these is PEQVNIA, which is written with a q in the great majority
of cases in the oldest inscriptions, although, curiously enough, the
first example os the word is in 10, where it appears as PECVNIAM.
Thus PECVNIA and its cases take a Q about twenty-six times in 11,
