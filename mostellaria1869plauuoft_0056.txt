xxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Orthography qf Long Vowels.

Quintilian and some of the later grammarians explicitly state that
in the earliest times long syllables were distinguished in writing by
doubling the vowel. Thus I. O. Ι. vii. 14:

“ Semivocales non geminare diu fuit usitatissimi moris: atque e
contrario usque ad Accium et ultra, porrectas syllabas geminis, ut
dixi, vocalibus scripserunt. Diutius duravit, ut e, i, iungendis, eadem
ratione qua Graeci ει, uterentur. Ea casibus numerisque discreta
est, ut Lucilius praecipit ’¹ &e.

And Mar. Victor. p. 2456, “ Naevius et Liw‘us, cum longa syllaba
scribenda esset, duas vocales ponebant, praeterquam quae in I literam
inciderant, hanc enim per E et I scribebant.”

Acting upon this principle, Dtintyer, who published an edition of
the fragments of Livius Andronicus (Berol. 1835), represents them
in the following fashion:

“In seedeis collocat see reegiaas
Clutaimneestra iuxtim, tertiaas naatai occupant
ss * * ³1<
Quin, quod paareere voos maaiestaas mea
Procat, toleraatis, templooque hanc deeduucitis.”

But in so far as the doubling of vowels is concerned‚ it seems
certain that no such system prevailed generally at the period when
our oldest inscriptions were engraved, and these belong to an epoch
as remote as Livius, and much more remote than Pacuvius, Accius,
and Ennius. Thus on the tombs of Scipio Barbatus and his son
we have CORNELIVS, BARBRTVS, PROGNATVS, DVO-
NoRVM, VIRTVTEL vos, OPSIDES.

The practice was not altogether unknown, for we find a few
examples here and there, but these are so rare that we might almost
ascribe them to ignorance or accident. In the whole of the twenty
inscriptions we have enumerated above there are only seven in-
stances, and the whole of these are found in 16 (No. 202 Momm.)‚
which is as late as B.C. 81, viz. HAACE LEGE, HOICE
LEEGEI, SEESE twice, LVVCI (from LVX), and PEGVLATVV*
twice, while in the same inscription LEGE or LEGEM occur three
times, and LVCI twice.

* Observe that both Iunci and pegulatuu are anomalous on other con-
sidcrations.
