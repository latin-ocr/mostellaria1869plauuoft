MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. xi

So also 1. i. 12 was originally mitten
Sine modo venire salvos quem absentem comes,

but has been changed by correction into

, , v t comedis,
Sme modo ventre salvos quem- absentem comes

where the correction of salvos into salvum is from Bb and the
marginal comedzls· srom Bc. The corrections of b are frequently
rough and coarse.

5. Occasionally stops are inserted in red ink.

6. Occasionally a black line is draxm under a word, as if to call
attention to something doubtful or erroneous, as in 1. i. 52, which

appears in B
O carnificum cribrum. quod credo sore

 

where the line under carmficum is in ink blacker than that of the

first hand. Moreover there is a mark over the first i, carnficum, as
if the first hand had wished to substitute a u for the ι, but it is b)
no means distinct.

So again, II. i. 70 is written,

Neque quicquam nobis pariant exeisz'n commodi,

the nne being in black ink. ’

So 11. ii. 68 was written,

Quia premalure vila care opcrfidcm,

the e at the end of premalum the whole of the word vila, and the
c following, being written over an erasure, and being much blacker
than the rest. Then some reader was startled by the combination
operfidem‚ and drew a line under it, and then lines were drawn to
separate the o from perfidum, so that the whole now appears as

 

Quia premature vila care 0,2t>erfidem.

 

These lines occur very frequently in several plays (eg. the leudem),
and more or less in all, or nearly all.

7. But there is another class of corrections in B to which
special attention must be directed. These are inserted in small
spaces left blank in the MS„ in a small, scratchy hand in red
ink, and are intended to complete imperfect lines. These are con-
jectural emendations by Camerarius, and written in his own hand,
and therefore of no value except as specimens of ingenuity.
Several examples will be found in III. i., e. g. v. 6, argenium
senori; v. 7, opus in sumplus fu1'l,· v. 21, alque ,· v. 2 3, T 11, [Ve-
gat inquam. T R. Perii oppz'd0‚· v. 24, [Van confilelur, and many

others.
