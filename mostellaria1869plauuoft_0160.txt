but it is more simple to make neutiquam hui a Spondee. The best
MSS. have et ei instead of hei, but this does not affect the scansion.

Poen. Ι. i. 71 (Senar.)‚
Sine damno magno quae elui neutiquam potest,

where neutiquam must be a dissyllable. These are the whole of the

examples in the Delphin index, and the same are given in the index

of W„ preceded by the remark “ neutiquam prima correpta.'’ 1 think

1 am justified in asserting that neutiquam is uniformly a dissyllable.
Now for neuter. Mero. ΙΙΙ. i. 40 (Iamb. Tetr. Cat.),

Neuter strupri causa caput limaret—Di inmortales ,Ι

where neuter is a Spondee. Neuter is found also in Cas. V. iv. 32
and Stich. V. iv. 51, but in both these passages the text is so
uncertain that nothing can be founded on it. In Stich. Ι. ἰί. 84
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Certumne est, neutram vostrarum persequi imperium patris?
neutram is a Spondee ; so also in Mil. II. ν. 18 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),
Et tu et hic—lVon nos novistie—Neutram—Metuo maxume,·

Rud. ΙΙΙ. vi. 16 (Senar.)‚
Vtrum vis, opta, dum licet !——Neutrum volo,-

and Frag. Vidular. 6 (apparently Iamb. Tetr. Acat.),
Ego servabo, quasi sequestro detis: neutri reddibo donicum.
In Aul. II. ii. 56 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),
lVeutrubi habeam stabile stabulum, si quid divorti suat,
neutrub' is a Trochee, as also in Men. V. ii. 35 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),
Vt caveres neuter ad me iretis cum querimonia.

In every case, therefore, in which neuter occurs, neuter may be
naturally scanned as a dissyllable and Spondee.
Amator. Weise quotes as examples of amator with the first long,

Cas. III. iii. 2 (Senar.)‚
Hominem amatorem ullum ad forum procedere,

where surely it is quite as good to make the 1st foot a Tribrach as
an Anapaest; again, Epid. 11. ii. 30 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Obviam ornatae occurrebant, ffi quaeque amatoribus,

where it is better to leave a hiatus after quaeque than to lengthen cim.
(It will be observed that W must be pronounced as a monosyllable.)
So in Merc. Prol. 4 (Senar.)‚
