METRE AND PROSODY. xcv

where the difficulty may at once be removed by introducing, as
proposed by Bothe, indu, the old form of z‘n.
2. v. 140 (Senar.),

qunc hodie Amphitruo veniet huc ab exercitu.

Bothe maintains that as hic and hoc pronouns are of doubtful
quantity, the same holds good in the earlier poets with regard to
lu'c and huc adverbs, although this is opposed to the dictum of the
grammarians. If we have a choice of difficulties, few will hesitate

to make brac short rather than exercitu.
3. I. iii. 6 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Sed ubi summus imperator non adest ad exercitum.

W. gets rid of the difficulty by proposing to read esercz'lu, but
unfortunately there seems to be no authority for this form. I would

suggest that the true reading is—

Sed ubi summus imperator non adest exercitu,

where exercitu is the dative. Some half-learned transcribet mistook
this for exercitu, i. e. exercitum, and then the ad was inserted to
complete the construction.

Weise, in his Index (first edition), gives four additional examples
of exercilus udth the ex short, all of them from the Amphitruo.

1. Prol. 102 (Senar.)‚

Is priusquam ln'nc abiit ipsemet in exercitum,

where the line scans perfectly xm'th a Spondee in the fifth place and

a Tribrach in the fourth.
2. I. i. 245 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Qui cum Amphitruone hinc una iveram z'n exendum,

where W. leaves the last syllable in iveram unelided, and supposes
the first in exercitum to be short. It is quite as simple to suppose
that cum is not elided, in which case the line scans easily with an

Anapaest in the sixth place.
3. II. ii. 101 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

‘Neque meum pedem huc intuli eliam in aeda, ut cum exercitu.

There are several ways in which the line may be scanned without
shortening the first in exercitu: pedem may be pronounced as a
monosyllable, and then totally elided ; or huc may be taken as short ;
or we may leave cum unelided; or we may resort to a simple trans-
position, and rcad Neque pedem mcum.
