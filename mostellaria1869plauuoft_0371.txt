EXCVRSVS 11.-DVJJ. 1 87

m'lu'l amplius. The following combination is unusual: Heaut. ΙΙΙ. ii.
32, Et nunc qm'd expecta, Sure? an dum hz'nc denuo Abeal, quom
tolerare huius sumplus non queat P ‘is he waiting until.'

Perhaps, wherever dum, standing alone, signifies ‘until‚’ there may
be an ellipse of usque or some such word, and this is sometimes
supplied; Pers. I. i. 53, Vsque ero domi dum excoxero lenoni malum,
‘up to the time when3’ Mero. Prol. 77, Adeo dum, quae lum haberes,
peperisset bona, ‘he said that he had persevered in this course, up to
the time when (until) he had acquired the property of which he was
then in possession.’ See this line quoted above, under odeo (p. 180).

4. ‘While' indicating duration of time, ‘as long as‚' ‘so long as‚' as
in English, ‘I shall love him while he lives‚‘' i.e. ‘as long as he
lives;' Truc. H. i. 23, Dum habeat lum ame& ube· m'lziltlzobeal, alium
quaeslum coepz'ot; Rud. ΙΙ. vi. 73, Qus'd, stulte, ploras .> lz'bz' quidem edepol
copia esl, Dum lingua vivet, qui rem solvas omm'bus,· Eun. IV. v, 2,
Atat! dala hercle verba mihi sunl: vicl? vinum quod Mhi,- Ac, dum
adcubabom, quom videbar mihi esse pulcre sobrius! Postquam surrexi,
neque pes, neque mens salis suum (fficium fizcz'l, ‘ as long as I was
reclining at table ;’ Heaut. V. v. 14, Haec dum inczpz'as gravio sunl,
Dumque ignores, ubi cognoris, sacz'lt'a .· the first dum may be rendered
‘until' or ‘while,’ the second ‘so long as.’

Dum when used in this sense is sometimes preceded by lanlz‘sper,
and thus is closely connected with ‘until 3' Truc. Prol. 11, Athenae
istae sumo, ila ul hoc esl proscenium, Tantisper dum transegimus hanc
Comoedz'am ,· Heaut. Ι. i. 54, Ego te meum esse dici tantisper volo,
Dum quod le degnum eslsacz'es ,· and so again, v. 95, Decrevi tantisper
me minus iniuriae, Chreme, meo gnato facere, dum fiam misen· and so
paulisper dum, Cic. pro Mil. 10.

In like manner usque adeo sometimes precedes dum ,· Eun. IV. vi. 4,
Vsque adeo ego illius serre possum implius el magmfica verba, Verba
dum sinn· verum enim sz' ad rem cotgserenlur vapulabt'l.

For other examples of dum signifying ‘as long as‚' see Eun. V.
iv. 12; Phor. V. viii. 41; Heaut. ΙΙ. iii. 104, IV. iii. 36, V. i. 78;
Andr. 111. iii. 24, V. i. 13.

5. It frequently happens that when ‘while’ means ‘as long as‚⁷ a
condition is implied, and hence the transition to ‘provided that' is
easy: thus when we say, ‘while the child is obedient he will nothe
punished‚' it is much the same as ‘provided that the child be obe-
dient' διε. Dum is common with this force, and is in this case always
followed by the subjunctive; Pers. I. iii. 66, Quaeso, hercle, me quoque

etiam vendas, ,τί lubet, Dum solutum vendas, ‘ provided always that you
