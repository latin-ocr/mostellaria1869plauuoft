EXCVRSVS VL-NAM, ENIM, ‹tl-c. 209

a direct answer, accompanied by an explanation, to a direct question,
and may be translated ‘because’

It will be unnecessary to examine the following passages at length.
We shall merely give the references, and suggest the clauses to be
supplied.

Amph. 1. i. 175. Mercury, in order to play upon the fears of
Sosia, pretends to be groping about doubtfully in the dark: ‘ 1 cannot
be mistaken, certe enz'm,’ &c., and then in the next line but one he
continues, ‘ there is no doubt about it, lzz‘nc enim,’ &c.; Aul. III. v. 26,
‘I have a just claim, enim mihi quz'dem‚' &c.; V. i. 4, ‘I cannot be
mistaken, cerlo enim,’ &c.; Bac. ΙΙΙ. iii. 53, Lydus having exclaimed
(v. 51), Fortunatam lVicobulum qui illum produxit sibi! is interrupted,
but continues in the next line but one, ‘well may I say so, lu'c enims
but in fact it is not absolutely necessary to supply anything ; Capt.
111. iv. 36, ‘ you expect to be believed, Ι suppose, lu enim reperlusss &c.;
IV. ii. 80, ‘just so, non enz'm,’ &c.; Cas. 11.v. 15, ‘she is in a fine
rage, negavi enim? &c., see v. 17 ; ΙΙΙ. i. 11, Stalino having quoted
a line from Naevius, Alcesimus replies‚ slleminem, on which Stalino
sneeringly rejoins, ‘doubtless you do, nunc enim le,’ &c.; Men. I. ii. 52,
the parasite exclaims, ‘what do I say? you may be easy upon that
score,’ or ‘it is quite unnecessary to ask such a question, z'd em‘m‚’ &c.;
Mil. II. v. 19, Sceledrus is in a state of bewilderment‚ Palaestrio asks,
Quid metuis? on which Sceledrus, Enim—ne nos perdiderimus uspiam,
‘I am afraid, for I fear lest‚’ &c.; iii. 12, ‘ no, no, non enims &c.; III.
i. 215, ‘be easy, ego enims διο. ; IV. ii. 27, ‘you need say no more,
enim cognovi,' &c.; Most. III. ii. 143 (141), it is scarcely necessary to
supply anything here, ‘the pillars are good enough if coated with
pitch‚' non enim, &c., ‘ for the workmanship is excellent 3’ Pers. ΙΙ. ii.
54, Sophoclidisca, in answer to a question, says, ‘what's your busi-
ness?' to which Paegnium retorts, ‘I'll let you see that it's my business,
enim non ibis . . . nisz',' &c3 Truc. 1. ii. 27, I would punctuate At, enim
amabo, sine me ire quo eas, and not At enim, amabo &c.; ΙΙ. ii. 54,
enim refers to what Stratilax had said previously, ‘I shall report your
proceedings to the old gendeman, . . . for he is one who‚' διο.

IV. Enim vero. The words enim vero signify ‘for in sooth‚’ and serve
to explain or illustrate some preceding statement. It is often neces·
sary, as in the case of the simple enim, to supply a connecting clause,
but this is, for the most part, easy and obvious; Capt. Prol. 22, Hic
nunc domi servit suo patri, nec scil paler, Em'm vero Dz' nos quasi pilas
homzms habent, ‘this may appear strange, but need not excite our

wonder, for in sooth the Gods toss us men about as if we were balls
