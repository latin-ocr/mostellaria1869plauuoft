satisfaction.’* In the Vulgate text of Men. V. vii. 49 we find
redhz'bebo, but there the true reading is probably reddibo for reddam.
See Non. s. v. reddz'bo, pp. 476 and 508. The word is generally used
in reference to the purchase and sale of slaves, as may be seen by
consulting the authorities referred to above, and from Cic. de Off.
III. 23, In mancipio vendendo dicendane vitta, non ea, quae nisi dixeris,
redhibeatur mancipium iure civili, sed haec, mendacem esse, aleatorem,
furacem, ebriosum.

141. pultiphagus opifex. . . barbarus] i. e. ‘no clumsy porridge-
eating Roman workman.' Plautus, when translating or adapting his
Greek originals, often loves to assume the position of an Athenian
writer, and to raise a laugh by designating himself and his country-
men as barbari: of this we have several examples, e. g. As. Prol. 11,
huic nomen Graece Onagos fabulae, Demophilus scripsit, Marcus vortit
barbare ‚· and again, Trin. Prol. 18, Huic nomen Graece est Thesauro
fabulae, Philemo scripsit, Plautus vortit barbare. In Capt. 111. i. 32,
barbarica lege is probably ‘Roman law ;' in the same play, IV. ii. 102,
Ergasilus swears by Cora, Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, and Alatrium,
upon which Hegio asks, Quid lu per barbaricas urbes iurasae³ in Mil.
II. ii. 56, poetae barbaro is Naevius; in Poen. III. ii. 21, and in a
fragment of the Faeneratrix quoted by Festus s.v. Vapula Papiria,
p. 372, ed. Mun„ barbaria is Italy; in Stich. I. iii. 49, mores barbaros
are Roman customs. On the other hand, barbarum hospitem, Rud. II.
vii. 25, is simply ‘a foreign guest ;' and there is nothing in the
phrase or the context which would justify us in asserting that
barbarico ritu in Cas. III. vi. 19 refers especially to Roman customs.
In Curc. I. ii. 63, ludii is Ludii, i. e. Lydians, who were not properly
Greeks, and therefore are termed Ludii barbari. In Bac. I. ii. 13,
lVimium quam, O Lude, es barbarus Quam ego sapere nimio censui plus
quam Thalem, I, stultior es barbaro Potitio .· barbarus is used in the
general sense of ‘illiterate,' and then barbaro Potitio signifies ‘that
ignorant savage, the Roman Potitius.' The epithet pultiphagus
(pultifagus) which is an ἅπ. λεγ. ties down the barbarus to a Roman
workman, for puls or porridge made ofsar was the ancient national

dish among the Roman peasants, as polenta was among the rustic
Greeks. See Val. Max. II. 5, ξ 5, and Plin. H. N. XVIII. 8, who,

* In Forcellini and Freund this is explained to mean, ‘ he, the seller, said
that he would take her back 3' but this is contrary to the established use of
the word, and is quite unnecessary, indeed it is inadmissible‚ for Demea
replies, nihil istoc opus est Litigare ego nolo vos,—whereas, if the seller had
agreed to take her back, there was no room for litigation.
