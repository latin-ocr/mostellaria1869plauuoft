METRE AND PROSODY. xcvii

Mil. II. iv. 26 (Iamb. Tetr. Cat.),
Nec finestra nisi clatrata.-—Nam cerlo ego le hic inlus vidi,

where W. reads nec, R. neque, without remark ; Ba has fenetra, A and
all the rest, fenestra. Clalrala or clathrata is a conjectural emendation;
A has neque clarala; all the rest, nisi clarata. We learn however
from Macrobius, S. ΙΙΙ. 12, that there was an old Latin word seslra
used by Ennius, the precise meaning of which was a subject of dis-
cussion in the age of Cicero, and which was interpreted to signify
ostium minusculum, while Paul. Diae. p. 91, ed. Mun„ says expressly,
‘⁴ Festram antiqui dicebant quam nos senesmzm ,·’' Miille'r in his note
sayS, “ Corrupte Placidus, p. 464: F restrum, fenestram.’' and refers to
Doederlein, Syn. et Etym„ Tom. VI„ p. 127, q. v. Festram is quoted
from Petronius also, Frag. xxi. 6, but there it is a conjectural emen-
dation for sestam of the MSS. There can be little doubt therefore
that Bothe was fully justified in substituting feslra sor fenestra in the
passages quoted above. The word feslra or fenestra does not, ap-
parently, occur elsewhere in Plautus.

Jnvidziz, Ingenium. We have a line in Terent. Andr. Ι. i. 39 (Senar.),

Sine invidia laudem invenias, el amicos pares,

where B. “Ceterum invidia primam hic corripit ut pote positione
tantum longam: sono literae I hic exili: adde quod in primo versus
pede maior concessa sit licentia. Sic ingenium primam corripit,
III. i. 8 '’ (Senar.),

Bonum ingenium narras adulescenlis— Oplumum.

The true explanation is the same in both cases; sine and bonum
being words which may be pronounced as monosyllables, are in these
passages altogether elided.

sntro. The following examples of intro have been quoted: Aul.

111. iii. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Ile sane nunc 'iam intro omnes el coci el tibicinae,

but it is much more simple to regard iam as a monosyllable elided
before intro ; 11. viii. 22 (Senar.),

Nimirum occidor nisi ego intro huc propero currere,

but even thus the line will not scan unless we read ni for miri or sink
ego altogether. Gulielmus and others, relying upon a MS., insert
propere before propero, thus transforming the line into a Troch. Tetr.

Cat., but the whole of this scene is composed of Senarians. Stich.
IV. i. 29 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

D—eos salutatum alque uxorem modo intro dcz'orlor domum.
