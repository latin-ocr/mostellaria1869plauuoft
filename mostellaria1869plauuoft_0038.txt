xii PROLEGOMENA.

There is one correction, probably of a late date, in the margin

of ΙΙΙ. ii. 5,

alqnanz Non mihi forle visum ilico fuit,
i. e. aliqui legunt nam. This appears to be the only example of a
correction in this hand in this play, and it is impossible to assign
a date to it either positive or relative: the ink is rather pale.

Finally, there are here and there, especially towards the end of
the play, some corrections and remarks written in black ink in a
hand strongly resembling that of Camerarius, and which have been
ascribed to him: Thus, in Ι. iii. 93, which appears in B,

illulz'er quese suamq etalem spernit speculo elusa est,

where the a in elusa is written over an erasure, we find in the margin
in the hand spoken of, ei usus est. These notes, by whomsoever
written, are evidently modern, and may be safely neglected by any
collator, however scrupulous. They are most numerous in ΠΙ. ii.,
and sometimes are a sort of explanatory commentary‚ as in v. 26,

Hoc habet repperi qui senem ducerem,
where we find, interlined above repperi, astaldum· and so in v. 51,
above qui is written quomodo as an explanation.
The following is a list of the interpolations in red ink by Came-
rarius in the Mostellaria .·

ΙΙΙ. i. 6, 7, stands in B,
Danista adest qui dedit,

Qui amica dal empta quq’
Camer. completes the lines with argenta finorz'A and opus in silplus

fuit. Δ

v. 21 stands in B,
T H. (so written above)

Dixtin queso . dlxi inquam ordine omnia.
Camer. has alque interlined above the words inquam ordine*
v. 23 stands in B,
Negalf quom cogita.
Camer. corrects, T H. Negat inquam. Tre. perii oppido, and an 0 in
red ink over the a in cogz'la.
v. 24 stands in B [with some scratches below and above the

syllables εί c0n.--ED.],
dicam si consessus sil

Camer. has Non confitetur? and then some scratches [the first being
apparently an erasure of the name Thea, or Tra.-ED.].

* [Or rather between the two.—ED.]
