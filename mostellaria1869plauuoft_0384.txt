1 98 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

1. Correction of a positive blunder: Cist. II. i. 37, A. Itaque me
Iuno rcgz'mz ct Iovis supremi filia, Itaque me Saturnus patruus eius.
M. Ecastor, pater. A. Itaque me Ops opulenta illius avia. M. Imo,
mater quidem, ‘no‚ n0‚ Ops was his mother, not his grandmotherz’
here the correction of the first mistake is introduced by Ecastor.

Simple correction: Cist. II. iii. 22, P. An, amabo, meretrix illa est,
quae illam sustulit τ’ L. Imo me’retrersuz't. The last words must not
be translated ‘yes, she was‚'' but the emphasis depends upon the
change of tense from the present est to the past ficit. Phanostrata⁴
asks, ‘xx-hat, tell me‚I beg, is that woman who brought him up an
hetaera?' to which Lampadius replies, ‘ no, she is not, but she was:
she is an old woman now!

The use of imo in the following passage must be ranked under this
head ; Eun. 111. i. 17, Thraso is boasting of the confidence reposed
in him hythe Rex whom he served, and goes on, T. T um me con-
vivam solum abducebat sibi. G. Hui! Regem elegantem narras. Τ. Imo
se'c homo est Perpaucorum hominum. G. lmo nullorum arbitror, Si
tecum vivit: here, in each case, imo introduces a correction: G. ‘You
describe a king fastidious in the choice of his associates‚' to which
Thraso, all unconscious of the contemptuous irony os Gnatho, replies,
T. ‘ Nay (you must not suppose that he has many associates), such
as he is towards me (although treating me with the highest distinc-
tion), he is one who bestows his sriendship on very few men,' on
which Gnatho remarks aside, ‘nay, (say rather) on none at all, if he
lives with )·ou,' the emphasis being on nullorum hominum, ‘on none
who deserve the name of men, if you are a sample of his favourites!

2. Again‚ imo is often used to correct and improve some expres-
sion, the correction frequently consisting in the substitution of a
strong word sor a weak one; Eun. IV. vii. 41, T. Quid nunc agimus?
G. Quin redeamus: iam llaec tibi aderit supplicans Vltro. T. Credin?
G. Imo certe, novi z'ngem'mn mulierum .· here imo certe does not mean
⁴ yes, assuredly‚’ but imo is introduced with reference to the word
credin, which implies a certain degree of doubt. The true translation
is, therefore, T. *Do you believe that?’ G. ‘(Believe it !) no, no,
(‘believe' is too weak a word,) Ι am sure of it ;’ Phor. I. ii. 95,
D. Νοη multum habet Quod detsortasse. G. Imo m'lu'l, misi spem meram,
which we must render, D. ‘Perhaps he has not much to give? G. ‘N0‚
(‘multum' is not the word‚) he has nothing ;’ Eun. ΙΙ. iii. 36, C. Is,
dum sequor hanc, fit nntriobt't'am. P. Incommode, hercle. C. Imo enim-
vero itfile'cz'ter, Μῖνι incommoda alia sunt debenda, Parmeno. I mo refers
to mcommode. ‘No'¹ ‘incommode‘ is not the word, you should have
