to undergo Capitis· Demz'nulio. This being premised‚ the adjective
Capitalis when employed with reference to (2) and (3) may be applied
to what affects the physical lifh, or to what affects the polz'tz'cal lifie.
1. As affecting the physical life it signifies literally ‘deadly' or
‘dangerous to life,' and in this sense it occurs in Mil. II. iii. 23,
Tuis nunc cruribus capitique fraudem capitalem hinc creas, i. e. ‘you
are raising up a deadly injury to limb and life ;' so capitali ex
periculo, Rud. ΙΙ. iii. 193 vectus capitali periculo, Trin. IV. iii. 81;
and figurafively, Poen. IV. ii. 57, Scin lu herum tuum meo hero
esse inimicum capitalem, i. e. ‘a deadly enemy 3’ so ira capitalis in
Hor. S. I. vii. 13; and odium capitale in Cicero de Am. 1. Hence
Capitalis signifies ‘terrible,⁷ ‘atrocious,’ as in the passage now
before us, and in Adel. IV. vii. 3, D. Fero alia flagitia ad le in-
gentia Boni illius adulescentis. M. Ecce aulem. D. Nova, Capitalia,
i. e. ‘atrocious3' and so in Cicero we have capitalis oratio, capi-
talis z'nz'uslzlzkz, capitalem et pestg'fmvcm Antonii reditum, and even
capitalis homo. 2. As affecting the political life capitalis is ex-
tensively employed with regard to crimina] proceedingS. Since the
punishment for some criminal offences was death, but for a much
larger class was some penalty which entailed capilii deminutzb, the
phrases res capitalis, causa facinus crimen capitale, z'udz'cium capi-
tale, poena capitalis, taken by themselves, are ambiguous, and their
force must in each case be determined by the context. They
may signify a ‘capital’ charge trial or punishment, according to the
English force of the term in such cases, but much more frequently
they indicate merely a charge trial or punishment affecting the poli-
tical privileges but not the life of the person implicated. 3. Since
anything which affects either the physical or political life of an
individual is of serious importance to him, capitalis occasionally
signifies ‘of paramount importance3' and so we may take Stich. III.
ii. 46, Eam auspicavi ego in re capitali mea, ‘ upon her I depended for
an omen when all my best interests were at stake.’ 4. Occasionally,
Capitalis is found in the sense of ‘excellent,' as when we talk of
‘a capital speech,' ‘a capital dinner,' or the like3 thus Ovid. Fast.
‘HL 8393 Cic. ad Q. F. Π. 133 Trebell. Poll. XXX. Tyrann. 10; all
of which are quoted in Forcellini.

Before quitting Capitalis we must notice Capz'tal, which is used as
a substantive, but appears to be merely the abbreviated form of the
neuter capitale. It is used 1. with lzbzteum, vestimentum, velum or some
such word understood, to signify a napkin worn upon the head by

priestesses. “Item texta fasciola qua capillum in capite alligarent
