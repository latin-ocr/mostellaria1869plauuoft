METRE AND PROSODY. lxxix

saw this difficulty very clearly,* and was obliged to have recourse to
the strange and gratuitous hypothesis that this rule, with regard to the
accentuation of the last syllable, was enforced in the second dipode
of an Iambic Trimeter‚ but might be freely neglected in the first and
third dipode‚ but he is obliged to admit that even these limits, wide
as they are, will not embrace every case, and that examples occur,
even in the second dipode of a Senarian, where the last syllable os
a polysyllable must receive the Ictus.

To show that we are not misrepresenting the views of this great
but rash scholar, we give his very words :—

diximus, de secunda tantum Trimetri διποδίᾳ capiendum; nam in
prima et tertia semper licuit; siquidem ista sine venia conclamatum

actumque erat de Comoedia Tragoediaque Latina. Cum igitur hunc
versum similesque apud nostrum videris,

illalum quod zstz' di deaeque omneis duint,

cave vitio id poetae verteris; etsi Malum illud et Omnes si in
communi quis sermone sic acuisset, deridiculo fuisset. Nimirum
aures vel invitae patienter id ferebant, sine quo ne una quidem
in fabula scaena poterat edolari. * * * * In secunda igitur
Trimetri διποδίᾳ hoc de quo agimus non licebat. * * * *

Rarissime igitur, semel atque iterum, sed magno sententiae lucro,
admisit hoc in Trimetris Terentius;

Persuasit nox amor vinum, adolescentia
Scelesta ovem lupo commisi, dispudet.
Nam illud

Nosse omnia haec salus est adolescentibus

in hac editione Salute est.'’

Hence we find, in every page, s0l6, ducturum, habe't, homini,
corrumpi, cfimmutaturam, or the like. It must be understood there-
fore that these marks, which distinguish Bentley's edition, and which
have been adopted by several recent editors os Plautus and Terence,

Taum priore licet brevi pronuntiabant, numquam nisi in Versu Deam,
Virum, Meam, ‘Tuuml' lt is to be observed that in not one of the passages

referred to by Bentley is there the slightest indication of the limitation
he would insist upon.
