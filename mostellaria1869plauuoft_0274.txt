94 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

in Pers. II. ii. ιι, Scio fidei hercle· herili ut soleat zmpudiclltiz oppro-
brarier, where fidei herili means ⁴ honesty of a slave (i. e. when a slave
is honest) in the service os his master;’ and the import os the passage
is, ‘I know that it is usual for a slave who is honest in the service of
his master to be twitted with impure motives.’ In so far as the
sentiment os the passage is concerned, it is repeated below, IV. i.
3, 5. Weise, who explains “Sensus debet esse: scio heros non
stare solere promissis‚’' has entirely mistaken the meaning, which
was correctly apprehended by Acidalius.

4. te. . . ulciscarprobe] We have the same words in Poen.V. iv. 58,
A'unc pol ego te ulciscar probe. Vlciscor, in Plautus and Terence. is
generally construed, as here, with the accusative of the person on
whom vengeance is to be taken.* Sometimes we have in the
ablative the kind of punishment, as Cas. 11. i. 8, Flagitium illud
hominis ! ego illum fizme, ego illum Siti, maledicitis, malefactis, amatorem
Vlciscar: but it is also construed with the accusative of the thing on
account of which vengeance is taken, as in this play, the third line
from the end, Ibi utrumque, el hoc et illud, poteris ulcisci probe‚· so also
Poen. V. v. 1, Si ego minam non ullus suero probe, quam lenoni dedi
Tum prcfi’clo me sibi habento scurrae lutificata& and Trin. V. ii. 49,
illiserunt est male promerita, ul merita, sz' mihi ulcisci non licet, i. e. ‘ It
is very provoking if Ι am not allowed to inflict upon evil deeds the
punishment they have deserved.’ This is the speech of Charmides
after he had unwillingly agreed to forgive his son. Weise appears
to have mistaken the meaning when he says, “ Sensus: miserum est
si mihi non licet et filium punire, et amicum remunerare aut gratias
referre ei;'’ and he seems to have had some misgiving, for he adds,
“ Sed haec sententia aliquanto plus iusto perplexa est.'’

5. Exi, inquam, nidor, e culina] i. e. ‘corne forth, you stinking
scullion.' The reading is very doubtful, and was probably suggested
to Pylades or some other early corrector by the line in Juvenal S.
V. 162, Captum le nidore suae putat me culinae, and that in Martial
Ῑ. xciii. (xcii.) 9, PascerI's cl mgrrae solo nidore culinae. le'dor properly
signifies the smell, smoke, or vapour proceeding from some object
when burned, and generally indicates a rank, foetid, or suffocating

* So Amph. IV. iii. 9; As. 1. ii. 22; Cas. 11. iv. ²03 Bac.111. iv. 9, istanc
ulciscar multis modis,· Bac. V. 2, 69; Epid. 11. ii. 843 Men. 1. ii. 17, {V- ii.
7²3 Pers. IV. vii. 16; Pseud. V. ii. 26; Rud. 111. iii. 36; Trin. 111.1. 18;
As. V. ii. 53, where the accusative of the person is understood, not ex·
pressed: and so And. 111. v. 18; Eun. lv. vi. ²4; Hec. 1. i. 15; Phor.
V. vii. 69. hunc nostro modo ulcisci.
