244 PLAVTI M OSTELLARIA.

One or two phrases connected with money and money payments
require some explanation.

(a) Commodus denotes that a sum mentioned is ‘of full weight;’
Rud. V. ii. 31, Talentum argenti commodum magnum inerat in crumena:
and As. ΙΙΙ. iii. 135, Qm'cl ego aliud exoptem amplius, m’si illud quoius
inopia est, Vtgt'nlz' argenti commodas minas huius quas dem matri? and
Merc. II. iii. 101, where the father and son are bidding in opposition‚
each pretending to be the agent of a friend, D. Etiam nunc adnutat:
addam sex minas. C. Septem mihi (AVumquam edepol me vincet hodie)
commodis poscit, pater.

Modicus seems to be employed in the same sense, Pseud. IV. vii.
130, B. Perdidit me. S. At me zwgrz'nte‘ modicis mulctavit mt'nz‘s.

(b) Probatus again indicates that the purity of the metal in the
coin or bullion had been tested ; thus Pers. IV. vi. 1, Probati hic
argenti sunt sexaginta minae, with which compare III. iii. 33.

(c) When Labrax says, Rud. III. iv. 21, Tu, senex, si tls-tas amas,
huc arido argento est opus, the phrase is probably equivalent to ‘hard
cash :' the explanations given by the older commentators are fancisul.
not to say ridiculous.

(d) Among the smaller denominations the T rt'obolum is frequently
mentioned, generally indefinitely sor a very small sum, as in Rud. V.
ii. 43, when Gripus is asked how much he demands for giving the
information sought‚ he replies, Talentum magnum, non j otest triobolum
hinc abesse, ‘a talent, not a sarthing less ;¹ and lower down, v. 67,
lVon illa· ego hodie debeo tm'obolum, ‘I don’t owe him a sarthing2’ see
also Bac. II. iii. 26, Poen. IV. ii. 46, Rud. IV. iii. 100, V. iii. 11: in
like manner Poen. I. ii. 168, lVon ego homo trioboli sum, nisi ego illi
masttjgz'ae Extat-bo oculos atque dentes, ‘I am a man not worth a
sarthing if' &c.; and the same expression recurs, 11. 17.

(e) Dt'obolorz's, an adjective, is found in Poen. Ι. ii. 58, and Frag.
Cistell. ap. Varr. L. L. VIII. 64, ed. Mun. See also Paul. Diae.
s. V„ p. 74, ed. Mun.

II. Plu'lzppus s. ll'umus Philzppcus. The coinage of Athens and of
the rest of Greece may be said to have consisted of silver and copper
cxclusively up to 350 B.C.‚ for although gold was occasionally minted
before that period, it was issued in very small quantities‚ and the
circulation was necessarily extremely limited. About the time however
indicated above, Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the

that during the remaindcr of his life he struck enormous numbers os
gold coins, which were speedily dispersed all over the world. These
