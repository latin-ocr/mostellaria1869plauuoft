EXCVRSVS XV.—SLA VE PUNJSHMENTS. 255

according to the natural force of the words, would lead us to infer
that the slaves were sometimes hung up by the feet, head downwards.
But it seems doubtful whether this is really the meaning of the
phrase: thus As. II. ii. 33, LE. Quot pondo led esse censes nudum Ρ
Lt. Non edepol scio. Lu. Scibam ego le nescire,- at pol ego, qui led
expendi, scio .· Nudus vinclus centum pondo es, quando pendes per pedes.
LI. Quo argumento istoc.) LE. Ego dicam quo atgumenlo el quo modo.
Ad pedes quando adligatus es, aequom cenlupondium, Vbi manus manicae
complexae sunl alque adduclae ad trabem, ,Nec dependis, nec propendis,
quin malus nequamque sis* Although the interpretation of some
portions of the above lines is by no means certain, it is quite evident
that when Leonidas says pendes per pedes he means ‘suspended by
the hands with the feet hanging down weighted,’ and hence when we
find in Cas. 11. vi. 38, 0. Mihi ul sortitio eveniat. C. Vl quidem
hercle pedibus pendeas, the signification is probably the same.

'Sometimes goads (slimzcli), that is, long poles with sharp iron
spikes, used for driving cattle, were employed to prick the flesh,
under the-pretext that the skin os habitual malefactors had become
so indurated as to be insensible to the lash: Pseud. I. ii. 4, Neque ego
homines magis asinos umquam vidi, ila plagis costae callent, Quos dum
ferias, tibi plus noceas, eo enim ingenio lu· sunl flagrilribae,· As. ΙΙ. iv.
1 2, L. Vtinam nunc slimulus in manu milti sil. M. Quiesce, quaeso.
L. Qui latera conteram lua quae obcalluere plagis; Cas. II. viii. 10, At
candidatus cedd lzic masllgt'a, Slt'mulorum loculi, ⁶ whose body is a
sheath for goads!

The goad might be applied to one hanging up: Men. V. v. 48, At
ego le pendentem fodiam stimulis lrtsginla dies ‚· or to one bearing about
the furca or palibulum (see below); Most. Ι. i. 52, O carnzficimn
cribrum, quod credo fore, Ila le forabunt palibulalum per vias Stimulis,
si huc reveniat [quam primum] senex.

In the lines last quoted reference is made to a form of torture to
which we find numerous allusions. A heavy log of wood was em-
ployed, forked at the extremity (furca), or with a cross pieee like
a gibbet (patibulum) ; the hands of the slave were attached to the
limbs of the log, which he dragged about, and was ssogged or goaded
as he staggered painfully under the load: Pers. V. ii. 72, T. Salis
sumpsimus supplici iam. D. F aleor, manus vobis do. T. Et post dabis
Sub surczlsj Men. V. v. 40, El ob eam rem in carcerem led esse com—
pactum scio, Et postquam es emissus, caesum virgis sub surca scio ,⁰

* Adligatus es, dependis, propendis are the readings of the best MSS„
which have been corrected plausibly adligatum est, (lependes‚'pr0pendes.
