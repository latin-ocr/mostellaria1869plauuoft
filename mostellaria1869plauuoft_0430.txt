os Alexandria. But in these and in all other places where the same
denominations were employed,

1 Talent = 60 Minae.
1 Mina = 100 Drachmae.
1 Drachma = 6 Obols.

Moreover, throughout Greece and her colonies in Asia and Africa,
when money was concerned, a Talent denoted sixty pounds' weight
of silver,* a Mina one pound weight of silver, and a Drachma
T3¹575th of a pound weight ‘of silver; but since the absolute weight of
the Mina varied in different districts, the actual money value of a
Talent, a Mina, and a Drachma varied in like proportion. Of these
three denominations the Drachma alone was a coin ; no piece of the
weight of a Talent or even of a Mina was ever minted for circulation.
The heaviest Greek coin known is a Decadrachm‚ the most common
are Tetradrachms and Didrachms‚† and the Athenians coined silver
pieces as low as a quarter-obol‚ or ,ΣΙ-,τὼ os a Drachma.

In the works of the Latin dramatists all computations in Greek
money must be referred to the Attic standard, and wherever mode-⁴
rate sums are named we shall not commit any grave error if we
consider the value of the

Attic Drachma 9d. sterling.

Since the Athenians employed silver as the standard of their
currency, wherever we find the words Talentum or Asina in Plautus
or Terence they uniformly denote respectively a sum of 6000 and
and 100 Drachmae, the word argenti being sometimes added and
sometimes omitted. Thus when we read in Merc. IV. iii. 4, Hem
quoi decem talenta dotis detuli‚· and in Heaut. V. i. 67, Duo talenta
pro re nostra ego esse decrevi satis, the same Talent is indicated as
when it is said, Phor. V. iii. 6, ex his praediis talenta argenti bina
Statim cap1'ebat,· and in Merc. Prol. 88, Talentum argenti ipsus sua
adnumerat manu: in the latter passage it is clearly implicd that the
value of a Talent was counted out in silver coin; and so As. 1. iii. 41,
Si mihi dantur duo talenta argenti numerata in manum.

But the expression Talentum magnum, which occurs frequently in

* 1f this does not hold good universally, the exceptions are not such
as require to he noticed here.
† This is to be understood of the Greek coinage in general- the Di-

drachms of Athens are extremely rare.
