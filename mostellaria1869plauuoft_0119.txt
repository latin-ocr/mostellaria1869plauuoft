METRE AN D PROSODY. lxxxi

before two consonants which follow in the same word: est, esse,
eccum, me, rste, ipse, Ξηᾱε, rande, ‘insum inter, nempe, bnans, and some
others.

In the above and other words of a similar character many metrical
scholars have maintained that there was an evident violation of the
Rule of Position, and scanned lines in which those words occur, as
if the last syllables in apud, amor, Sco.. were short, and so also the
first syllables in esse, eccum, &c.

But another solution of the difficulty has been proposed, which we
have no hesitation in adopting‚ viz„ that all the words given above
were occasionally‚ in familiar conversation, pronounced ‘correplz'm;’
that is, the first syllable was almost entirely suppressed in enunciating
the word, and thus the dissyllables were transformed into mono-
syllables. Much may be said in favour of this view.

1. It will be seen that, with very few trissing exceptions, all the
changes made by the Roman poets upon words are z'n llze dira-tion
qs contractz'on.

2. It will be observed that all the words enumerated in class 1
are dissyllables‚ having the first short, and that in the greater number
the short vowel is followed by a liquid, so that there would be little
difficulty in pronouncing them in a syncopated form without de-
stroying the sound of the word. Some of these words must be
pronounced ‘corr-epam? even when position is not involved.

3. Those in class 2 are all words which recur perpetually
in dialogue, and are exactly the kind of words which would be
abbreviated in conversation,

4. We can find abundance of analogies in our own language,
some of them completely in point.

5. If we pass to foreign languages we shall find that the same
holds good with respect to them.

6. If we trace the passage of certain of these words into the
Romance language we shall perceive that many of them were
adopted in an abbreviated form, thus affording an indication at
least that in the popular dialect such abbreviations were common.

Now before proceeding to give and discuss examples of the two
classes of metrical anomalies we have just mentioned, it is necessary
to call attention to the fact that even the epic and lyric writers of the
Augustan age assumed the right of modifying the form or pronun—
ciation of certain words which must otherwise have been altogether
excluded from their measures, or which, in their ordinary shape,

would have been productive of embarrassment. These changes have
