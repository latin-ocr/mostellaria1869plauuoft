charmel which receives the rain as it drops from the tiles, and carries

*it from the roof in a single stream. Such seems to be the explana-
tion of Isidorus XIX. 10 and of Pliny H. N. XXXV. 12, § 43, who,
when recounting the inventions of Dibutades of Sicyon, says, primusque
personas tegularum extremis imbricibus imposuit, although his words
are by no means clear. Imbrex occurs again in connection with
tegulae in Mil. ΙΙ. vi. 24, Quod meas confregisti imbrices et tegulas ,· and
in Sisenna Histor. ΙΙΙ., dissipates imbricum fragminibus ac testis tegu-
larum, quoted by Non. p. 125, s. v. Imbrices ac tegulas. From the
curved form of the imbrex it is used by Virgil in connection with an
arched roof (imbrice tecti, G. IV. 296); in Martial Epp. II. xxxvii. 2
it denotes some portion of a pig, flIammas suminis imbricemque porci,
but what portion we cannot tell ; while from the sound of water
rushing through a narrow channel it was applied to one of the forms
of theatrical applause executed by bodies of men trained for the
purpose (bombos et imbrices et testas vocabant), perhaps something
like our Kentislz fire. See the very curious passage in Sueton.
Ner. 20.

26. Nevolt] Observe that ne was the original form of the Latin
negative. Compare ne parcuntznon parcunt, ne quidem, nedum, and
such words as neglego, negotium, necopinatus.

27. Perpluont ligna] The verb perpluo is used by Plautus in
two ways, transitively and intransitively. Here it is used intransitively:
perpluont tigna, ‘the beams let in the water‚’ i. e. ‘the water makes
its way into the beams.’ In iii. 8 we have it in the transitive sense:
Haec illa est tempestas mea, milzi quae modestiam omnem Detexit tectus
qua sui quam mihi Amor et Cupido In pectus perpluit meum, i. e.
‘rained through into my heart ;' and in Trin. II. ii. 41, Bencsacta bene-
factis aliis pertegito ne perplacuit, i. e. intransitively, ‘lest they let the
water through.’ Perpluit is generally used impersonally, ‘to let rain
or liquid in through a crevice ;' but see Most. IV. i. 16, Malum quom
inpluit ceteros, non inpluat milu', and observe the change of construction.
For other examples of the use os perpluere see Fest. p. 250, ed. M.,
“Poteram perplovere in sacris quum dicerent, significabant pertusam
esse‚'’ i. e. ‘leaks, lets out the liquid,’ where we see the ancient form
plot-0, whence pluvius (cf. fluo-fluvius); Cato R. R. 155, In villa cum
pluet, circumire oportet, sicubi perpluat, et signare carbone, cum desierit
pluere, uti tegula mutetur, i. e. ‘water makes its way in.' Quint. VI.
ii. § 64 relates a witticism of Galba, who, when a person asked the
loan of a cloak, replicd, “Non possum commodare, domi mane0‚” and
then Quint. adds the explanation, cum cenaculum eius perplueret,
