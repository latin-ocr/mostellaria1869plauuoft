nunc, Dz'narcbe, where iam is added in order to give the utmost possible
emphasis: ‘ sor we consider you as ours, Dinarchus, even now at this
very time, critical as the conjuncture is.’ ‘We have elsam alque elsam
nunc in Aul. IV. ii. 7, conveying the idea of intense anxiety; Vide,
Fides, esiam alque eliam nunc, salvam ut aulam aps le alffi’ram, ‘ again
and again now in this hour of peril do I implore thee.y Etiam
tunm Rud. III. vi. 8, Etzizmne in ara lunc sedebant mulseres Quom acl
me prqfhclus ire ,Ρ Ellam dum ; Mil. IV. ii. 2, De'ssz'mulabo, llos quasi
non vz'dmm, neque esse lzz'c elsam dum sciam, ‘ even now at this present
time.’ See also Truc. II. 66, haud. . . elsam . . . dune.

Etiam is not seldom subjoined to quoque .· Pers. I. iii. 6 5. Quaeso hercle
me quoque eliam vendas, si labes, ‘sell me also even now,' ‘on the spot ;'
Mero. II. ii. 56, Quin mz‘lu' quoque elzizm est adportant negumate, ‘ why,
for that matter, I also even now have business at the harbour ς’ Amph.
Prol. 30, Atque ego quoque eliam qui Iovis sum filius Ccmlagl'one mei
patris metuo malum, ‘I also even now 3' Truc. I. i. 77, Cum ea quoque
etiam mz'lzz'fzcz'l commercium, ‘with her also, even now (i. e. already, on
a previous occasion) I have had dealings.’ Other examples of quaque
ctiam in Amph. Prol. 81, ΙΙ. ii. 85, 1213 Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 50, IV. ii. 19;
Men. V. ix. 983 Poen. Prol. 40: Truc. IV. ii. 18.

Quoque and ellam sometimes occur in the same clause, but not
linked together, and in this case may qualify different words.' Thus
in Amph. Ι. i. 125, where Sosia is speaking of the miraculous length
of the night, Eam quoque edepol elsam mullo haec vicit longitudine,
where etiam may be connected with mull0‚· so ΙΙ. ii. 70, eliam lu
quoque‚· and so As. II. iv, 95; III. ii. 21, ellam lucz quoque malefizcla‚·
Cure. I. ii. 40, eliam mslzz' quoquam· Pseud. Ι. iii. 119, quoted above;
i. 120, eliam matrem quoque,· Trin. IV. iii. 41, illis quoque abt-<grant
etiam fidem. In As. Ι. iii. 79 we have eliam pm'usquam,· in Cist. ΙΙ. iii.
43, etiam prius, Sed illaec se quamdam az'ebal mulzkrem Suam benevolentem
convenire eliam prius, ‘even now before sulfilling her promise to me!

Etiamnum is found in the text of some edd. of Truc. ΙΙ. vi. 5 3, but
rests upon no MS. authority: again, in τ’. 58, the words etiamnum mali
pendit, although the reading of the Palatine MSS„ are on all hands
regarded as corrupt. In Men. III. ii. 15, Ibo, ctsammmz reliquiarum
spes animum oblectat mcum, the true reading is probably ellamdmn.

It is not easy, however, in every case to determine with certainty
the precise force of eliam, or to fix on the word which it qualifies:
thus when, in Cure. I. iii. 16, Planesium says to Phaedromus,
PL. Tene me, amplectere, ergo. Pu. [soc elsam est quamobrem cupiam
vivere, Ι cannot agree with Weise that alsam qualifies [usuam :vra-re.-
