lxxii PROLEGOMENA.

Alustela murem ΙΙ apstulit praeter pedes,-

so all the MSS„ including A.
3. The Hepthemimcral Caesura in Iambic Trim. Hiatus is less

common in this than in the Penthemimeral, but is by no means rare.

Most. Ι. i. 38,
Dique omnes perdant: oboluisti ΙΙ allium.

Men. III. ii. 11,
Prandi, potavi, scortum accubui, ΙΙ apstuli.
Sometimes we find a hiatus both in the Penth. and the Hepth. in

the same line, e.g.‚ Most. Ι. i. 20,
Corrumpe herilem ΙΙ adulescentem ΙΙ optumum,

where Pylades foisted in filium, and Ritschl nostrum after herilem, in
order to bolster up the metre. Rud. III. vi. 21,
Ego hunc scelestum Η in ius rapiam ΙΙ exulem.
So also Mero. IV. iv. 15,
Videre, amplecti ΙΙ osculari ΙΙ adloqui,

where, if it were worth while, we might avoid the hiatus by writing

amplectier and oscularier.
We find in Trin. ΙΙ. iv, 138, 139, two lines in succession which

appear in all the best MSS. under the form—

lVam fulguritae sunt alternae ΙΙ arbores
Sues moriuntur angina ΙΙ acerrume.

In the former Camer. inserts hic after sunt, and is followed by W.,
while R. foists in zm,- in the second, Hermann has hic after angina,
R. has illi, Lind. transposes and reads—

Sues angina moriuntur acerruma,
leaving the last syllable in moriuntur long, and in his preface quotes

this as an example of this peeuliar prosody.
4. Wherever there is a distinct pause in the sense. Even Virgil

thought himself justified in wrsting, Ecl. ΙΙ. 53,

Addam cerea pruna: ΙΙ honos erit huic quoque pomo.

Et vera incessu patuit Dea. ΙΙ Ille ubi matrem.
Thus Capt. III. iii. 17,

Nugas ineptiasque incepso. ΙΙ - Haereo.
Cist. ΙΙ. iii. 12,
Age, perge, quaeso: ΙΙ animus audire expetit.
5. A fortiori when there is a transition in the mza'dle <ff a verse from

one speaker to another: thus Merc. Ι. ii. 74,

C. Out’poluil videre .> Η Α. Oculis. C. Ouo pacto? 11 Α. Hiantibus:
