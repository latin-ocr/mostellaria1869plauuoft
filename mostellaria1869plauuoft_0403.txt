EXCVRSVS V111.-Q VIN. 2 15

meet the eye in a written conversation. Again, the speaker may
affirm what has been said, but with a qualification3 this qualification
may be such as to strengthen the remark previously made, or it rnay
call in question the accuracy of a portion of the remark, and the
qualification may in certain cases be so important as to amount to
a contradiction.

The force of φαίη, when explanatory, may generally be rendered
by one or other of the English expressions ‘well, then‚' ‘ why, I tell
you‚' ‘but,' ‘nay‚’ ‘nay‚ for that matter‚' but the full force would'in
many cases be conveyed by the tone or gestures of the speaker. It
will be seen from some of the quotations that quin and imo are
occasionally equivalent.

What we have said will be more easily understood from the
following examples.

1. Quin equivalent to cur non in a simple direct interrogation
followed by the indicative: Most. I. iii. 12, Quin lu le exornas mori-
bus lepidis quom lepida tola es ,ν’ Trin. ΙΙΙ. iii. 73, Quid nunc slas ,Ρ φαίη
le hinc amoves el le moves? Merc. I. 77, 78, Eho tu, eho lu, φαίη cavisti,
ne eam videret, verbero Ρ Quin, sceleste, apslrudebas, ne eam conspiceret
pater.) The last example is specially remarkable because it is said
to be the only passage in Plautus in which φαίη, in the sense of cur
non, is followed by a past tense.

Sometimes the question is put in an indignant tone3 e. g. Trin. Ι.
ii, 81, Quin eum reslt'luzsz‘ Quin ad frugem corrz'gt'sf' or denotes im-
patience‚ as Men. IV. ii. 75, Quid id est ,ν’ quid laces.) quin dz'cz's quid
sz'ls‘ or conveys a remonstrance or entreaty, Pers. III. i. 69, Quin lu
me ductis, sz' quo ducturus, paler? Vel lu me vende, vel face quod tibi
lubel‚· and so Men. V. vii. 11, Epz‘damnz'enses, subvenite, cives! φαίη
me mz‘llz'lzls?

Quin is frequently followed by the imperative, and in this case the
expression may always be regarded as elliptical; thus Most. I. iii. 16,
Quin me aspice cl conlempla, is equivalent to Aspice el contempla me, quin
aspicis ,θ i. e. ‘look at me, why don’t you look?' and so again, v. 30,
Quin mone, quaeso, sz' quid erro . . . Alone, quaeso, φαίη mones ,ν’ i. e.
‘advise me, Ι beg, why don’t you?’ In III. i. 45 (41) we have a
good example, in the same line, of φαίη in a direct interrogation, and
also followed by the imperative; D. Quin lu istas millis tricas?
T. Quin quid vis cedo. Quin followed by the imperative may imply
encouragement3 thus Adel. IV. ii. 4, C. Perii! S. Quin lu animo
bono es, i. e. ‘cheer up, can't you?⁷ and in the previous scene, v. 17,
Quin otiosus es, ‘be easy, can't you?' There is an ellipse of the
