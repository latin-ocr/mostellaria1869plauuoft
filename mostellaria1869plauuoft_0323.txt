NOTES. ΙΙ. i. 10—47. 141

injunction or command, but not in the following: Eun. Π. i. 10,
Memini tametsi nullus moneaS. In the phrase nullus venit, As. ΙΙ. iv. 2,
Libanum in tonstrinam ul iusseram venire, nullus venit, nullus is cer-
tainly equivalent to the simple n0n,· nullus venit again, Rud. Ι. ii. 55,
II. ii. 17 ; and so, perhaps, neque ullus in II. iii.10; compare also
Men. V. v. 273 to which add Cas. IV. ii. 16, Qui amal, tamen lzercle
si esurit, nullum esurit ‘not at all? There is a remarkable use of
nullus in And. ΙΙ. ii. 33, which we may notice here; C. Liberatus
sum lzodz'e, Dave, lua opera. D. Ac nullus quidem, i. e. ‘and yet you
are not so‚' ‘you are not out of the wood.'

46. non lzoc longe, Delphinum] Hoc is deictic‚ ‘not so far as the
breadth of this nail‚’ pointing perhaps to the nail of his finger.
Cf. Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 80, Decedam ego illi de via, de semila, De honore
populi,· verum quod ad ventrem altine! lVon hercle hoc longe, nisi me
pugnis vicerit,- and Bac. ΠΙ. iii. 19, lVego libi hoc annis viginti fuisse
primes copiae, Digitum longe a paedagogo pedem ul efferres aedibus.

47. IVam inlus potale] The words inlus and intro are found again
and again in Plautus, chiefly in reference to the interior of a house,
and for the sake of the young scholar we may explain the force of
each.—1. Ixrcs. Iuliis has two distinct meanings. It is equis-alent
sometimes to the Greek ἔνδον, ‘xx-ithin,y no motion being implied,
and sometimes to the Greek ἔνδοθεν, ‘from within‚’ motion from
within outwards being indicated. 1. Of the first we have an ex-
ample in the line before uS, ‘For drink away inside the house ;'' and
in vv. 54, 55, Intus cave muttire quemquam siveris. P. Curabilur.
T. Tamquam si inlus natus nemo in aedibus, ‘Beware of permitting any
one to whisper inside‚’ . . . ‘just as if no living creature was dwelling
inside ;’ and in ΙΙΙ. ii. 12, lVam el cenandum et cubandum est intus
male. 2. Of the second also this scene will afford an example,
v. 57, clavem mi harunce aedium Laconicam Iam iube efferri inlus,
i. e. ‘to be brought out from within ;' and again, III. i. 145 (142),
evoca aliquem intus,· so exit inlus, Truc. II. i. 43 ; exilsorm inlus, Cas.
ΙΙ. ν. 42; arcessit inlus, Bac. IV. vi. 26; evocate intus, Men. Ι. iii. 35.
For other examples see Amph. ΙΙ. ii. 1385 Cist. III. 8; Cas. ΙΙ. v. 433
Epid.111. ii. 44, iv. 45, &c.—11. INTRo. Inlr0‚ on the other hand,
has only one meaning, and invariably denotes motion from without
inwards ; thus Most. II. i. 50, Omnium primum, Philematium, z'nlro abi,
‘ go away into the house ;¹ and again, III. ii. 161, ergo intro eo sz'ne per-
ductore. So Redi nunc iam intro alque inlus serva, Aul. I. ii. 3 ; sequere
lu intro, Epid. II. ii. 1203 remeabo intro, V. i. 55 ; vise intro, ii. 47;
