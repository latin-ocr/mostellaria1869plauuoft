256 PLAV'I'I MOSTELLARIA.

Cas. 11. viii. 2, Sine modo rus venial, ego remissam ad le virum Cum
sumu in urbem, mequam carbonarium, i. e. ‘as black with blows
as if he were a charcoal burner;'* vi. 37, 0. Τιιῑεο, Deos quaeso.
C. Vt quidem lu hodic canem † e! furcam fi'ras. O. Mihi ul sorlz'lt'o

A thief was sometimes branded with the three letters FVR, and
hence was called in derision literatus or trium literarum homo: Cas.
ΙΙ. vi. 48, C. Tu ul lulum-cas, ipse aclulum virgis calfizclabcre. S. Hoc
age sis, Olumpio. O. Si hic lsteratus me sina& Aul. ΙΙ. iv, 46, Tun'
trium literarum homo Me vituperas Β fur, ellam sur frisia-mser. ζ

When a slave belonging to the erile'a {wana had committed
some unpardonable ofl‘ence, or was found to be of habits incorrigibly
bad, he was transferred to the Familia Rustica, and was sent to the
country, where he was hardly used, frequently worked in chains. and
was employed in the most severe and distasteful labour. The sort
of toil most frequently referred to is working in the milis where the
corn was husked and ground (pistrinum—mola), and this task was
probably generally assigned to refractory town slaves because no
more skill was necessary than is required in turning a modern
tread-mill or prison—crank: Most. Ι. i. 18, Augebz's ruri numerum,

* lt is not impossible that there may be a double meaning here, and

that charcoal burners may have carried their burdens on a frame similar
to what French porters call a fourchette.

† Canem seems to be the reading of the MSS„ and if it is correct the
meaning must be left to conjecture. Meursius would substitute Camum
(the Greek κημός, a muzzle or twitch for a horse), which is supposed to

mean a ‘collar' or ‘chain’ in a passage quoted from Accius by Nonius,
p. 200.

† Stigmatias is used to denote a branded slave m Cic. de Off. 11. 7, § 25,
Ο miserum, qut fideliorem et barbarum et stigmatiam putaret quam coniugem!

a passage quoted by Nonius (41). Stigmosus is found· m Petronius Arbiter,
c. 109, and in Plin. Epp. 1. ν. quoted from M. Regulus.

§ The expression in mundo occurs elsewhere in Plautus, Cas. 111. iii. 3,
Stultitia magna est, mea quidem sententia, Hominem amatorem ullum ad forum
procedere In eum diem, quoi quod amet in mundo siet, · Epid. V. 1. 12, S. Habe
bonum animum. E. Quippe ego quoi libertas in mundo sita est ‚· Pers. I. i. 46,

Τ. Quaesivi (sc. argentum), nusquam repperi. S. Quaeram equidem si quis
credat. T. Nempe haheo in mundo. 1t is explained by Paul. Diae. p. 109,
