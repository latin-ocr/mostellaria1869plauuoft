a later hand. To the same class belong erasures made we cannot
tell by whom, as in 1. i. 42,

lVon omnes possunt olere unguenta exotica,
which was originally written in B,

lVon omnes possunt tolere unguenta exotica,
but the t has been erased, leaving only a faint trace, and this erasure
may or may not have been the work of the first hand. Ritschl
therefore is hardly justified in giving tolere as the reading of Ba
without remark*

3. Corrections in ink which is perfectly black, and which must
proceed from a late hand. Most of the stops and marks of interro-
gation have been added by this hand. These corrections in black
. ink are made in two ways, either in the word, or over the word.
Thus in Ι. i. 15 the writing in the original brown ink has

Rus mihi tu obiecta sanehcredo tranio,
but an s is added in black ink at the end of obiecta,· oc has been
added to the lz in ink darker than the original‚† but this may arise
srorn an erasure made between sane and credo, some wrong word
haxing stood there. A point has been added in red ink after obiectas,

so that the whole now stands,

Rus mihi tu obiectas. sanssoccredo tranz'o.

Again, Ι. i. 31 was written originally in B,
Ante hoc est habitus pacus nec magts contineas,
but an r has been inserted in black ink after a in pacus, and an
n also in black written over the α in contineas, so that the line
now appears in the MS.
Ante hac est habitus pc'icus nec magis contz‘nefgs.

This hand is called Bb by Ritschl.

4. Corrections on the margin, written in a particularly neat, small
hand with a fine-pointed pen, and preceded by a t. The ink of
this hand is intermediate in colour between the brown of the original
MS. and the jet-black of the last corrector. This hand is called

Bc by Ritschl. We have a good example of the correction of this
hand in Ι. i. 5,

Exi inquam . nidore ciipz'nam quid tales* t culm}

* [My opinion is that the t is by the first hand. The ink is of the sarne
colom, and the correction appears to have been made at once—Eu]

† [1 cannot agree with the author in thinking the ink of this cor-
rection darker than that of the original writing. lt appears to me to bc,
if any-thing, somewhat saintet than the average—En]
