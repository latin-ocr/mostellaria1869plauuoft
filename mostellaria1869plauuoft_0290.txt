1 10 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

flourished aster Augustus, as Freund asserts in his Lexicon, sor Varro
R. R. III. 17 says that Hortensius kept a body of fishermen in his
pay to furnish the precious inhabitants of his ponds (piscinae) with
little fishes‚ and that when the weather was so tempestuous that they
could not bring to shore in their nets vivam saginam, then he supplied
them with morsels of salted fish (salsamenta), where vivam saginam
must signify ‘living food,’ in contradiction to the salsamenta or
pickled tunny.* Hence we have the verb sagenare, ‘to fatten‚’ sagi-
natus and saginandus,· and Varro R. R. ΙΙΙ. 10 supplies us with the
term saginarium for a ‘ fattening coop.' This being premised we
may pass on to examine the three passages in Plautus, in addition
to that before us, where the word is found. 1. Most. Ι. iii. 78 (77),
Iam isla quidem apsumpta res erit, dies noctesque estur, bibitur Ne-
que quisquam parsimoniam adhibet ,· sagina plane est, which the older
commentators explain, ‘the place is a regular fatting coop,’ making
sagz‘nazsagmarium. But this is quite unnecessary, and we may keep
to the strict sense, ‘it is a clear case of stuffing and cramming.’
Again‚ 2. Trin. ΙΙΙ. ii. 96, where Stasimus, speaking of his master as
about to enter the service of some foreign prince, says, Aut aliquem
ad regem in saginam herus se coniecit meus, i. e. ‘in order that he may
grow sat at his eost ;’ and we have a parallel to this in Cicero pro
Flacco VII„ quper epulati, paullo ante omni largz'tzbne saturati, Per-
gameni, quod Methridates, qui multitudinem illam non auctoritate sed
sagina tenebat, se velle dixit, z'd sutores, z‘d zonarii conclamarunt, Cf.
also Tacit. H. II. 71. 3. The third example is in Mil. ΙΙΙ. ii. 31,
where a drunken slave, who had been stealing wine, says that if his
misdeeds are discovered, Postea sagina ego eiciar cellaria, where the
term sagina cellaria, being evidently a whimsieal phrase coined to
raise a laugh, must not be pressed too closely. But none of these
throw any light upon the phrase before us. B has saginam caedite,
the rest cedite. Lambinus adopts cedite and explains it date, that is,
give me food for my oxen. But this would involve a false quantity,
for in that case cedite must be regarded as equivalent to cette and ν
connected with cedo, ‘ give me,’ and then it would be impossible to
scan the line. Weise renders the words by cibos comedite, than which
nothing could be more tame. Forcellini finds a way out of the difficulty
by assigning a special meaning to sagina, of which this passage affords
the only example, viz. ipsum animal sagina pinquesaclum, in which
case we might render the line, ‘ eat, cram yourselves, slay the fatted

* The passage in Propert. IV. viii. 25 is·not decisivo.
