EXCVRSVS XV.—SLA VE PcwISHMENT S. 261

qumella s. Numellus seems to signify a combination of a collar
for the neck with stocks for the feet. Similar contrivances were
employed for confining cattle and dogs. See Nonius (144), ί(Λίι-
mellae machinae genus ligneum ad discruciandos noxios paratum,
quo et collum et pedes inmittunt. Plautus Aulularia, nervos, catenas,
carcerem, numellas, pedicas, boz'as‚” where “ Aulularia ⁷’ is a mistake
for “Asinaria” Paul. Diac. p. 172, ed. Mull„ “ll''umella genus
w'nculi quo quadrupedes deligantur.’' See also Colum. R. R. VI.
19, VII. 8.

Boia. That this was a collar would be proved by a passage in
Prudent. Psychom. Praef. 33, attrita boiis colla, if we could depend
upon the text, but the reading is very doubtful. Plautus has a pun-
ning joke upon the word in Capt. IV. ii. 108, and it will be observed
that in the passage which we are discussing numellas, pedicas, boias
are placed together.

Nervus s. Nervam is explained by Festus, p. 165, ed. Muli:
“lVervum appellamus etiam ferreum vinculum quo pedes inpedi-
untur: quamquam Plautus eo etiam cervices vinciri ait perfidiose
captus eo epol nervo cervices probat.” The word occurs again in Aul.
IV. x. 13, Capt. III. v. 71, Curc. V. iii. 12, 40, 45, Poen. V. iv. 99,
Rud. ΙΙΙ. vi. 34, 38, 51. In the last there seems to be a direct
reference to the neck: Credo aliam z'n aliam beluam hominem vos-tier,
Illic z'n columbum, credo, leno vortitur, Λάηι in columbari collum haud
mullo post erit, In nervom ille hodie nz'damenla congeret,- where colum-
bare must mean a collar, and is introduced in connection with
columbus in consequence of its resemblance to columbanum. In
many passages nervus is equivalent to a chain, hence may signify
a prison, and this may be the meaning in the line just quoted. Cf.
Cure. V. iii. 40. In Phor. ΙΙ. ii. 10 the expression O zv'rsorlt's alque
amicus J verum hoc saepe, Phormio, Vereor, ne istaec forlt'ludo t'n nervom
erumpat denique, seems to be equivalent to our ‘should come to
grief.’ In the same play, IV. iv. 15, In nervom polius ibit probably
means ‘he will go to gaol first.' It would appear that the original
meaning of nervus or nervum, which is probably identical with the
Greek νεῦρον, was not, as lexicographers insist, ‘a muscle’ or ‘ sinew’
or ‘tendon‚’ but ‘a thong or strap made of hide‚' and hence ‘a
cord' or ‘string,' the anatomical application being figurative and
¹secondary. In all the oldest Latin writers it is generally equivalent
to vincula, either in the sense of a collar, or of bonds, or of a place
of confinement. In the Laws of the XII. Tables, as quoted by
Aul. Gell. XX. 1, with regard to insolvent debtors, the creditor is
