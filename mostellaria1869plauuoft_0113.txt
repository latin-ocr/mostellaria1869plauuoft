METRE AND PROSODY. lxxv

that several words which are not comprehended in the definitior]
appear to violate the Law of Position. ι

3. This we shall give in the words of Bentley, as he claims the
doctrine as original: “Illud tanturn monebo, quod ante me opinor
nemo—In primo fere versuum pede, et parcius alias, Licentiam
hane exercuisse Nostrumt* idque rectissimo iudicio: cum Actor,
in fine prioris versus anima recepta, plenum rapidumque spiritum
posset effundere.'’ He then quotes thirty-eight examples from
Terence.

’ Here again the observation, although just to a certain extent, is
stated too strongly. There are many examples of this licence at
the beginning of a line, but we cannot say that they are even com-
paratively rare in other parts of the verse. The explanation seems
altogether fanciful.

We may now consider the opinion os Hermann, and this is
deserving of the most caresul study and the greatest respect on
account of his profound scliolarship, singular acuteness, and the
special attention which he devoted throughout his long life to
metrical topics. His views may be gathered from a number of
passages in his great work, the Elementa Doctrinae slselrz'cae, but
they are distinctly and tersely enunciated in his Epilome Doctrinae
Λίείνίεαε, and seem to have undergone no change during the long
period which elapsed between the publication of the first edition
and the appearance of the third in 1852, the words in both (ξ 79)
being the same :—

“Apud Latinos duplex recitatio in usu fuit, una accentum max-
ime vocabulorum et vulgarem pronuntiationem sequens, qua scenici
veteres usi sunt, altera ad Graecorum exemplum conformata, quae
ab Ennio primum in epicam poesin, Augusti aevo in omnia fere
genera poeseos introducta est. Scenica illa recitatio abundat cor-
reptionibus, neque curat positionem, unde ille, alque, Philippi, iuven-
tutis et alia plurima correptis ante duplicem consonantem vocalibus
pronuntiantur. Quin etiam vocales longas corripiunt, ubi ultima
eliditur ut concede huc, secede huc.’'

It will be observed that in the above passage a fact is stated and
an explanation given. It is stated as a fact that the dramatists
neglect the Rule of Position (this without limitation), and that they
moreover in certain cases shorten vowels naturally long. The
explanation proposed is that there were two modes of pronouncing
Latin; the one natural, national, and familiar to all, the other
