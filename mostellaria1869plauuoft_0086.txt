III.—THE METRES AND PROSODY OF PLAUTUS.

C omt'c flIelres.*

There is no topic connected with classical literature which,
generally speaking, proves so repulsive to a young scholar as an
inquiry into the metres of Plautus and Terence. This arises not
so much from the difficulties which the subject presents, although
these are unquestionably numerous and perplexing, as from the
manner in which the subject has been handled. He will find him-
self called upon to peruse a series of disquisitions by different
authors who accord with each other neither in principles nor details,
but, on the contrary, exhibit sor the most part fierce antagonism‚
agreeing in this only, that each propounds his ideas with dogmatic
confidence, and assumes a contemptuous and insolent tone towards
those whose views differ from his own.

The extreme positions in the controversy are held by two
parties. The followers of the one, whenever they encounter a
difficulty, are satisfied with calling it a ‘licence'—-a term which,
if used freely and without discrimination, suffices to abrogate all
metrical laws.

Those who adhere to the other have persuaded themselves that
the verses of Plautus and Terence were constructed with the same
delicate care, precision‚ and strictness which characterise those of
the best Greek models, and that wherever we meet with any com-
bination inconsistent with this doctrine we must at once pronounce
the passage corrupt, and proceed to correct it. If we adopt this
view to its full extent, we shall be called upon to re-write at least
one-fourth of the plays now extant.

The ample space between these two poles has been occupied by
those who entertain more moderate opinions, and who by their
researches have done much to throw light upon what is obscure.
But almost every one of these has some favourite hypothesis ap-
plicable to a particular class of cases; these hypotheses are for the
most part founded on a very limited and imperfect induction‚ and

* Throughout this chapter it is taken for granted that the reader is
familiar with Latin prosody and versification, as exhibited in the works of
the Latin poets from Lucretius and Catullus downwards.
