270 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

The substantive circumductio is found in the same sense: Capt. V..
Cat. 3, Nec pueri suppositio, nec argenti circumductio.

Circumvenire: Hec. Prol. 46, ch eum circumventum inique iniqui
inrideant.

Circumire: Phor. IV. iii. 9, Tun dixeras huic ἓ facinus md1grnum‚
Chrcme, Sic circumiri.*

Circumverlere : Pseud. I. v. 125, Quid si hice inter se consenserunt,
C alliplw, Aul de compacto faciunt consutis dolis, Qui me argento circum-
vortant? Here the idea may be similar to that expressed in familiar
English when we talk of ‘one person twisting another round his
finger‚' and this leads us to observe that a great number of curious
phrases, which express fraud and trickery, represent the person
deceived as an object animate or inanimate, as the case may be,
under the absolute control os the deceiver, who can deal with him
as he pleases.

13. Vendere. Venalis. Thus he is sometimes said ‘to be sold,’†
as a master might dispose of a slave: Bac. IV. vii. 16, C. 0 stulte,
stulte, nosces nunc venire te? Atque in co ljoso adstas lapide, ube· praeco
praedicat. N. Responde, quis me vendit? When slaves were sold by
auction they were made to stand upon a stone, to elevate them above
the crowd, so that they might be distinctly seen by intending pur·
chasers. Cicero refers to this practice (In Pison. 15) when he calls
Serranus and Numerius duos de lapide emptos tribunos. Again, Mil. 11.
vi. 97, Me habent venalem: sensi et iamdudum scio, ll'umquam hercle
ex ista nassa ego hodie escam petam, ‘they are selling me ; assuredly
I shall not nibble the bait out of that trap to-day.'

14. Sublinere s. Oblincre os. According to a favourite figure, he
is represented as a helpless drunkard who falls asleep at a banquet
and has his face blackened by his companions—a practical joke by
no means unknown in our own day.‡ Thus Merc. ΙΙ. iv. 17, Vin
patri sublinere pulcre me os tuo? ‘to besool your father handsomely ;'
Aul. IV. vi. 1, F idei censebam maxumam multo fidem Esse, ea sublevit

* Circumire is sometimes quoted from Pseud. 111. ii. ¹09 in this sense,
but upon referring to the passage it will be seen that here it may simply
mean ‘ he is going about.’

† Mark the identity with English modern slang, to say nothing of the
Shakespearian: ‘lt would make a man as mad as a buck to be so bought
and sold,’ Comedy of Errors, 111. i.; ‘bought and sold Lord Talbot,’ K. Hen.
vl. Part 1. Act 1V. iv.; and ‘ Diccon, thy master is bought and sold:
Richd. 111. Act V. iii.

' 1 A short time ago the Police Reports contained the case of some
young rnen who were brought up before 'a magistrate for blackening the
face of an old woman whom they found lying drunk on London Bridge.
