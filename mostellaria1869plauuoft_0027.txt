PROLEGOMENA.

I.—THE TEXT.

Αἰ· the period of the revival of letters eight only of the Comedies
of Plautus were known to the learned, viz. the Amphitruo, Asinaria,
Aulularia, Captivi, Casina, Cz'slellaria, Curculio, and the Epidicus.
The first announcement of the existence of a MS. containing the
whole of the twenty which we now possess is made in a letter written
from Rome about the beginning of 1429, by Poggio Bracciolini, at
that time Apostolic Secretary to Pope Martin V, in which he informs
his friend Niccolo Niccoli at Florence that Nicolas of Treves had
discovered in Germany several classical works, and among others a
volume containing twenty plays of Plautus, and Poggio gives the titles
of all the new pieces. In reality the MS. was found to comprise six-
teen only, but of these twelve were previously unknown, the Casina,
Clitellarz'a, Curculio, and Epidicus being omitted. About the close
of the year Nicolas arrived in Rome with his treasures, which were
delivered to Cardinal Giordano Orsini, as we learn from another
letter of Poggio written on December 27, 1429, and his words are
so important that they deserve to be transcribed—

‘⁴ Nicolaus Trevirensis huc venit afferens secum sexdecim Plauti
comoedias in uno volumine, in quibus quatuor sunt ex iis quas
habemus ; scilicet Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi; duodecim
autem ex lucro; hae sunt: Bacchides, Mustellaria, Menaechmi, Miles
Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus, Persa, Rudens, Stichus,
Trinummus, Truculentus. Has nondum aliquis transcripsit, neque
. enim earum copiam nobis facit Cardinalis: tamen adhuc nullus

praeter me petiit. Liber est illis litteris antiquis corruptis, quales
sunt Quintiliani, et multa in multis desunt. Non faciam transcribi,
nisi prius illas legero, atque emendavero: nam nisi viri eruditi manu
scribantur, inutilis erit labor.’' And again, in another letter, January
6, 1431—-

‘·Nullus‚ mihi crede, Plautum bene transcribet, nisi is sit doctissimus:
