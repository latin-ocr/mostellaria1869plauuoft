xxiv PROLEGOMENA.

word, or a whole class of words, was prevalent up to and for some
time after the time os our poet, and that the more modern forms did
not come into general use till after his time, we must consider this
evidence to be conclusive, and might without scruple, and even in
defiance of MS. authority, employ that mode of spelling in the text
of our poet. In other cases, where usage even in early times seems
to have varied, or where the number of instances in inscriptions is so
small as not to warrant us in arriving at any general conclusion, or,
lastly, where inscriptions afford no evidence at all, we must be content
to follow the method adopted with regard to the orthography of the
later writers by our most distinguished modern scholars, and follow
implicitly‚ in variety as well as in uniformity, the evidence afforded by
our best MSS. Lachmann, Ritschl‚ Fleckeisen, and others in Ger-
many, Mr. Munro in this country, have done vast service by pointing
out how tenacious the best MSS. are of particular modes of spelling,
and how great a mistake it is to suppose that in ancient spelling
uniformity rather than variety was the rule.

For the purpose of enabling us to decide, so far as the evidence
of extant inscriptions will permit, what are those archaic forms of
spelling which it is most probable that Plautus actually employed, we
have selected for special examination twenty of the most important
and reliable of the early inscriptions from the Corpus of Mommsen,
and, with a view to facilitating reference, have numbered them, as in
the annexed table, from 1 up to 20, by which numbers they will be
referred to in the course of the following remarks—En]
