xcvi PROLEGOMENA.

4. V. ii. 7 (Senar.)‚
Tu gravidam item ficzstz', quom z'n exercitum,

where quom is not elided, and then the fourth foot is a Dactyl.
Accepz'sti seems to occur in Trin. IV. ii. 122 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Vel trecentis—Haben tu z'd aurum quod accepisti a Charmide ,ν’

This seems to be the reading of the MSS„ and if retained would in-
volve the shortening of arccepzstzg· but a case of this sort fully justifies
a simple transposition ; read therefore with Hermann—-

Vel trecentis—Haben tu aurum id quod accepisti a Charmide τ’

which is more natural and obvious than the emendation of R.
W. retains the Vulgate without remark.

Gabernabunt is quoted frorn Mil. IV. ii. 99. Even supposing the
line to form one of an Anapaestic system, the measure is avowedly
loose and irregular. W. says, in his Index, ‘gubernabunt correptim.’

Argenti is quoted from Capt. Cat. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

IVec pueri suppositio neque argenti circumductio,

which Ι would scan by pronouncing neque as a monosyllable‚ and
then eliding it altogether; again, in Cure. V. ii. 15 (Troch. Tetr.
Cat.),

Quod argentum, quas tu mz'lzz' tricas narras Β quam tu vzrgz‘nem ι’

quod, like quid, must be suppressed.* See other examples in the
Index of W. under quod est.
Astatia, apparently in Capt. ΙΙ. i. 53,

Memorz‘ter meminisse, inest spes nobis in hac astutia.

So the Vulgate. There is a difficulty in the scansion, which Linde-
mann removes by reading hac in astutia. Bothe has nobis huic
astutiae. [If for inest we substitute est, there would be no difficulty.
—En.]

Fenestra seems to occur in the following passages: Rud. Ι. i. 6

Senar. ,
< ) Illustrz‘ores fecit fenestrasque indidit ,-

Cas. Ι. 44 (stenar),
Quz'dsaczes ι’- Concludere in fenestram firmiter,-

Ξ [VVdould not this line be scanned more simply by transposing tu,
an rea lng-

Quod tu argentum, quas mihi tricas narras? quam tu UIrginem ἲ

-Ε1).]
