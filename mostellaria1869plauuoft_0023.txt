and is well known as the author of the most complete and
systematic Manual of Latin Prosody in the English language.
To the latest edition of that Manual he added an acute and
learned appendix on the so-called Saturnian verse, from which
it will be seen in how critical and sceptical a spirit he was
prepared to deal with the various metrical fancies of modern
German scholars, while the critical notes of this edition will
shew how rigorous he was in the demand for definite evidence
before admitting an emendation of the text on the ground of
metre only.

In the present work, the great difficulties which beset the
prosody of Plautus, and especially the great question whether
the anomalies of Plautine metre are to be explained by some
kind of contraction‚ or running together of syllables in quick
pronunciation‚ according to the view adopted by Mr. Ramsay,
or by supposing a wholesale violation of the ordinary laws of
Latin prosody, as these were observed by the later poets, cannot
be said to be either fully discussed or finally solved3 yet the
authority of a scholar who had made the subject of prosody
his peculiar study‚ will have some value3 the view adopted is
stated with some important modifications‚ and supported by
a large number of exampIes, many of them included amongst
those which have been brought forward by Dr. Wagner and
others in support of the rival theory, and which are here shewn
to be capable of an easy explanation other than that advanced
by them as part of their case. It is pointed out how few are
the words which can with any confidence be asserted to have
been used by Plautus with a quantity different from that ob-
served by later writers3 and the impression is left, that a cri-
tical examination into the objections commonly brought forward
to the theory of contraction or ‘correption‚' will bc found to
have but little solid foundation3 that the proof on the other
side is negative rather than positivc3 while in proportion as
the difficulties attending that theory are removed, the argument
