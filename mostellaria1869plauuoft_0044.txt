xviii PROLEGOMENA.

writers is frequently so corrupt that it is impossible to determine
their actual meaning. Of this we have a conspicuous example in
the earliest grammatica! essay which has corne down to us, viz. the
lines of Lucilius upon the termination EI, which are in such con-
fusion that it is impossible to elicit any satisfactory signification from
them without having recourse to a number of conjectural emendations.
Not that we would reject the evidence of the grammarians in a mass.
All that we find in Quintilian is worthy of the most serious attention,
and may for the most part be accepted without hesitation. The
authority of Priscian also is considerable, although he is by no means
a guide that can be entirely depended upon ; but the lower we
descend the less trustworthy do the authorities become, and their
evidence cannot be accepted except when corroborated by other
sources of information.

In order to give an idea of the small reliance that can be placed
upon the statements of the ancient grammarians in matters of ortho-
graphy, we may briefly examine their assertions with regard to the
doubling of consonants.

In cases where the same word occurs written sometimes with a
single, sometimes with a double consonant, it may be difficult to
decide with certainty which is the original form, but the presumption
will always be that the more simple form is also the most ancient.
Since no word or syllable can either begin or end with a doubled
consonant, it follows that wherever doubled consonants occur they
must stand between two vowels, except in the case of certain com-
pound words. But some of the old grammarians maintained that
a doubled consonant could not be admitted except after a short
vowel. Thus Cornut. ap. Cass. p. 2283 (ed. Putsh.):

“ Causa per unam S, nec quemquam moveat antiqua scriptura,
nam et accussare per duo SS scripserunt, sicut fuisse, divisisse, esse et
causasse per duo SS scripturn invenio. In qua enuntiatione quo-
modo duarum consonantium sonus exaudiatur, non invenio.'’ He
then goes on to give vostra, advorsum, pervorsum‚ volare (vetare),
vortex, convolvere, amploctere, as examples of archaic spelling out
of date in his time.

Compare with this Mar. Victorin. p. 2456: “Est itaque in principio
dicendum quemadmodum antiqui scripserint, dehinc quid nunc de-
beamus observare. Consonantes literas non geminabant ut in his
Annius, Lucullus, ildemmius, et cetera his similia, sed supra literam
quam geminari oportebat scilicet Sicilicum imponebant cuius figura
haec est, quod erat signum geminandi, sicut apparet in multis
