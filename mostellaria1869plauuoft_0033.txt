MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. vii

fasciculi or quaterniones, described above, which were numbered
XL, XLI, XLII, XLIII, and a few pages of XLIV. Of XL, XLI, no portion
remains, and the Palimpsest does not become available for this play
until we reach the second leaf of XLII (ΙΙΙ. i. 45). Altogether eight
leaves or sixteen pages remain of XLII, XLIII (i. e. one-half of XLII
and one-half of XLIII), more or less legible, but the leaves of XLIV,
which contained the continuation of the play from V. ii. I 1 to the end,
are lost. The MS. was written, like all those belonging to an early
period, in large, distinct, well-executed capitals; the lines in the
Iambic Senarians and Septenarians were correctly divided, but the
Trochaic and Iambic words which make up a line are not divided,
the letters being wn'tten continuously. When the dialogue passes
from one character to another at the beginning of a line, there is no
mark to indicate this, but when such a change takes place in the
middle of a line, then a blank space, such as would be occupied by
two letters, is lest, which it was probably intended to fill up with the
initial os the name in red ink. In like manner the scenes are divided
from each other by a blank space sufficient to contain two lines of
writing‚ and this in like manner it was intended should be filled up
with the names of the personages who took part in the action of
the scene in question.

B. T he Vetus Codex Camerarizl*

From the hands os Camerarius this MS. passed into the Palatine
Library at the beginning of the seventeenth century, was conveyed to
Rome in the year 1622, and is still preserved in the library of the
Vatican among the Palatine MSS. and numbered 1615.

The writing belongs to the eleventh century, and extends over
213 sheets of vellum in moderate-sized folio. It contains the whole
os the twenty extant plays of Plautus, together with the title of the
Vidularia subjoined to the Truculentus, while prefixed to the Am-
phitruo we find the Querolus.

The work, which for the most part is coarse and irregular, appears
to have been executed by a number of different hands, and in ink of
different colours. Not unfrequently the scribe has been changed more
than once in the course of a single play. This is especially conspicuous
in the case of the Persa, where we can distinctly trace five, if not six,
different hands, several leaves being written in ink which has saded to
