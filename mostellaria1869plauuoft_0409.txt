it ;’ Pers. Ι. i. 40, Qua confidenlaelz rogare lu a me argenium tantum
audes Impudense φαίη si egomet totus veneant, vix recipi polessz'l Quod
tu me rogas, nam lu aquam a pumice nunc postulas: here a contra-
diction is implied—‘ why (far from having such a sum at my disposal),
if Ι were to be sold bodily‚ bag and baggage,’ &c.; Eun. ΙΙ. i. 6,
Phaedria having given an order to Parmeno which calls forth a sort
of reproof from the slave, Phaedria adds, Ne istuc tam iniquo palz'are
animo. PAR. Ilffz'nume: φαίη effeclum dabo, ‘do not be so much
distressed by that piece of extravagance.’ PAR. ‘By no means: on
the contrary, I shall carry out your wishes3' Trin. II. iv. 63,
L. Oculum ego effodiam tibi δι’ verbum addideras. S. Hercle, φαίη
dicam tamen.- here we may suppose an ellipse of non ‹lelerrebis me
quin dicam, or, if we regard dicam as the future, we may translate
‘nay, but speak I will, in spite of your threats;' Merc. IV. iii. 25,
Lysimachus is being cross-questioned by his wife, and knows not
what answer to give; Dorippa repeats her interrogation, D. Quin
dz'czlvs’ L. Quin sz' liceat . . . D. Dictum oportuit, ‘why do you not
speak out?’ upon which Lysimachus in his embarrassment catches
up the φαίη, ‘nay, for that matter, if you would let me‚' . . . —there
was probably a pause of hesitation between φαίη and sz' liceat, which
ought to be indicated by the punctuation, Quin . . . sz' liceat . . .;
Eun. V. ii. 63, Quin, Bythias, Tu me servato: φαίη may seem here
to imply expostulation or remonstrance, ‘nay, come now, Pythias,
help me‚’ but we may regard it simply as a case of φιιίη followed
by the imperative, ‘save me, Pythias, why do you not aid me?'
Heaut. HI. iii. 20, C. Sure, pudet me. S. Credo, neque z'd iniuria.
Quin mz'lzz' molestum esl, ‘I well believe that you are ashamed, and
you have good reason. Why, 1 tell you (more than that) that even
I am annoyed by this business,’ with a strong emphasis on I,· IV.
v. 51, Chremes, convinced by the arguments of Syrus, agrees to pay
the money to Bacchis, Quin egomet iam ad eam afferam, ‘well, then,
not only am I willing to pay the money, but, more than that, I shall
carry it to her in person ;’ Phor. V. viii. 25, Ego, Nausistrata, esse
in hac re culpam meritam non nega, Sed eam, φαίη sz't tgnoscenda, ‘I do
not deny that guilt has been incurred in this matter, but I do deny
that the guilt has been such (eam=talem) as to be unpardonable,’
where φαίη is equivalent to ul non. If, with many MSS„ we read ea,
we must place a comma or hyphen aster sed—(nego culpam esse
talem) αί ea non sit zgrnoscenda, but in this case the ellipse is some·
what violent.
