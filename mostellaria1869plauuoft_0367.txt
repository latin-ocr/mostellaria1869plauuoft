EXCVRSVS 1.—ADEO. 1 83

Heaut. I. i. 1, Quamquam haec inter nos nuper notitia admodum est Inde
adeo quod agrum in proxumo hic mercatus es,· here adeo is explana-
tory, ‘arising in this way ;' and in the same sense v. 57, Nulla adeo
ex re istuc fit, nisi ex nimio olio, ‘from no other cause do matters go
on thus,' ‘in this way ;’ Amph. Prol. 72, Sive adeo aediles perfidiose
quoi duint, ‘ or whether in this manner (i.e. from influence‚ and not on
account of merit) the aediles have eorruptly bestowed the prize on
any competitor ;' Merc. V. iv. 33, Si, hercle, scivissem, sive adeo ioculo
dixisset mihi Se illam amare, ‘if he had thus (to this effect) spoken to
me in J'est ;’ True. IV. iii. 1, Egone tibi male dicam, aul tibi adeo male
velim! ‘is it possible that Ι should abuse you, or wish you evil after
this fashion;' Hee. IV. i. 9, Vir ego tuus sum ,θ Tun virum me, aut
hominem deputas adeo esse, ‘am Ι your husband? do you regard me
as your husband? or, (treating me) in this way, do you behave
towards me as to any ordinary man?' Andr. IV. iv. 20, D. Adeone
videmur vobis esse idonei In quibus sic inludatis.) C. Veni in tempore.
D. Propera adeo puerum tollere hinc ab ianua: here the first adeo
signifies ‘to such an extent‚’ the second ‘then' or ‘therefore‚’ and
expresses impatience, ‘ make haste, then, can’t you.'

qunc adeo is a very common combinadon, and in this phrase adeo
must be generally translated ‘therefore’ or ‘such being the case :’ Mil.
11.ii. 4, qunc adeo edico omnibus, ‘now then‚’ ‘now therefore‚’ ‘now‚ this
being the case ;' Mero. ΙΙ. ii. 57, Quin mihi quoque etiam est ad portum
negotium, ,Nunc adeo ibo illuc, ‘ now therefore‚’ ‘now, such being the
case3’ Rud. III. iv, 23, Do tibi argentum ! qunc adeo ut scias meam
sententiam, ‘I give you money! now therefore‚' ἃς. ; and adeo three
lines lower down may also be translated ‘therefore‚' or ‘such being
the case.’ So As. ΙΙΙ. i. 29, Men. I. ii. 11, Pseud. Ι. ii. 52, Truc. II.
ii. 12, Andr. IV. iv. 36.

Less common is adeo quasi: Heaut. V. i. 12, C. Quid ait?
Gaudere adeo coepit quasi qui cupiunt nuptias, ‘ he began to rejoice
ingthe same manner as those (eo modo quo) who are eager f0r‚' &o ;
here adeo might be referred to our second head, ‘to the same extent‚’
‘in the same degree as if he were one of these,' &o

We find also numquam adeo quin: Adel. II. ii. 13, Credo istuc
melius esse .· verum ego numquam adeo astutus fui Quin, quidquid
possem, mallem auferre potius in praesentia, ‘I never attained to such
a pitch of cunning as to refrain‚’ &a

The following deserve attention: Amph. I. ii. 4, Iam ille illuc ad
herum quom Amphitruonem advenerit, Narrabit servom hinc sese ex
foribus Sosiam Amovisse. Ille adeo illum mentiri sibi Credet, neque
