EXCVRSVS X.—FR VGI, NEQ VAM. 229

here give ut, which the verse requires, and not ulul of the Vulg. text:
the meaning will be ⁶ however (bad) the condition of my own affairs ;’
but Bentley renders it, ‘I rejoice in so far as the condition of my
own affairs permits me to rejoice.' The combination ulul occurs
several times in Plautus, where the reading is not doubtful, e. g. Most.
III. i. 14, Verum ulul rese sese habel, Pergam lurbare porro: ila haec
res postulat.

x.—FR ναί, NEQ VA M.

That frugi is frequently used as an indeclinable adjective by
writers of all epochs is unquestionable, and it is equally certain that
it is the dative case of frux, frugis. In Plautus it is frequently
construed with sum, and may in that case be regarded as a real
dative: As. ΙΙ. iv. 91, quamquam ego sum sordidatus, Frugi lamen sum ‚-
Pers. IV. i. 5, Si malus aul nequam est, male res vortunt quas (1317,- Sin
aulem frugi est, eveniunt frugaliter, and as if to mark the word more
distinetly as a substantive the epithet bonae is often added ; Pseud. Ι.
v. 53, Cupis me esse nequam, lamen ero frugi bonae,· As. ΙΙΙ. iii. 12,
Numquam bonae frugi sz'enl, dies noctesque potent, while the accusative
frugem is occasionally found in the same sense ; thus Trin. I. ii. 81,
Quin ad frugem conrzgrz'ss‘ ΙΙ. i. 34, Certum est ad frugem adplz'care
animum,- Poen. IV. ii. 70, Herus sz‘ tuus volet facere frugem‚· but in
many instances it must be regarded as indeclinabie, as may be
observed in some of the examples given below.

The true meaning of frugi is clearly indicated by the etymology—
it is used to denote that a person is ‘profitable' or ‘useful' either
to himself or to others. Thus it assumes many modifications of
meaning*

1. When used with reference to one who is profitable to himself
it may signify ‘economical' or ‘thrifty‚’ as in the following lines,
where it is opposed to benegnus: Truc. Ι. i. 13, Tentat benignusne an
bonae frugi εἴθε,- v. 20, si id quod oratur dedit, Atque est benignus polius
quam frugi bonae: or ‘prudent‚' Capt. II. ii. 44, Philocrates lzz'c fecit
hominem frugi ul facere oportuit: or ‘respectable‚' Cure. IV. ii. 16,
Nec vobiscum quisquam in foro frugi consistere audet; and so Aul. IV.
ix. 6, Quid est τ’ quid ridens? novi omnes .· scio sures esse lzic complures
