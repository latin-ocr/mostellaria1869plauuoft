31. in aliam partem] i. e. ‘moving in a different direction, towards
a different goal.' The young scholar must remember that in is
followed by the accusative not only when it denotes actual physical
motion towards a person, place, or thing, but also when it denotes
an action tending towards some definite result, or a movement of the
mind in the direction of or towards any particular object. So below,
v. 64, in vesperum, ‘ against evening,' i. e. ‘ with a view to my eyening
repast;’ and so I. ii. 38 (41), in firmitatem, ‘with a view to secure
strength 3’ and in the next line, in usum, ‘with a view to their being
practically serviceablef in speciem ‘with a view to fair appearance,' &c.

33. Quid tibi, malum, me, aut quid ego agam, curatio] i. e. ‘ what
business have you, confound you, to look after me or my proceed-
ings?’ The construction quid curatio est tibi me, in which the
accusative is put after the verbal substantive in io, is by no means
uncommon in Plautus. Quid tibi hanc curatio est rem, verbero, aul
mutitio? Amph. Ι. iii. 21; Sed quid tibi, nos mendice homo, tactio est?
Aul. III. ii. 93 Quid tibi ergo meam, me invita, tactio est? Aul. IV. x.
14 ; Quid tibi huc receptio ad te est meum virum fl As. V. ii. 70;
Quid tibi istunc tactz'o est ,Ρ Cas. II. vi. 543 Quid tibi tactio buncsuvit,
ib. 56; Quid istum tibi tactio est ,Ρ Curc. V. ii. 27; Quid me vobis
tactio est ,θ Men. V. vii. 273 Quid tibi hanc dzgito tactio ests³ Poen.
V. ν. 29; Quid tibi huc ventio est ,Ρ Quid tibi hanc aditio est ,ν’ Quid
tibi hanc notio est, amicam meam Β Truc. ΙΙ. vii. 61. In all the
above examples, with the exception of that from Amph. Ι. iii. 21,
where rem is in reality equivalent to me, we have the accusative of
a person; when a place is introduced, sometimes a preposition
is supplied before the accusative, as Quid tibi ad hasce accessio
aedes est prope aut pallatio? Truc. ΙΙ. ii. 3 (cf. Quid illi ex utero
exitio est? Truc. II. vi. 30); and sometimes the accusative is
expressed by an adverb, Quid illi reditio huc etiam fuit? Most. ΙΙ.
i. 30 ;“ Quid tibi interpellatio aut in concilium huc accessio est ,θ
Trin. III. ii. 83; and so in the example quoted above from Truc.
II. vii. 61. We find the dative after auscultatio, Rud. ΙΙ. vi. 18.
Quid mihi scelesto tibi erat auscultatio, Quidve hinc abitio, quidve
in navem inscensio? It will be observed that in all the above
examples, 1. the clause is interrogative with quid, the verb sum, and
the dative of a pronoun (tibi, mihi, vobis, illi) ; 2. the verbal sub-
stantive ends in i0,· 3. there is uniformly an expression of impatience,
indignation, remonstrance, or anger. Hence such constructions as
