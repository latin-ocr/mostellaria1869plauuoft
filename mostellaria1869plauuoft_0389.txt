EXCVRSVS V.-MODO. 203

is about to begin a long story to which he has no time to listen‚
replies quickly, ‘certainly not:' and then adds testily‚ ‘ even now (at
this critical time) he is entering upon some history or other.’ The
punctuation ought to be, Imo: etiam narrationis incipit initium.
The common punctuation is Imo etiam: and the translation given is
‘yes, certainly :' which is manifestly altogether inconsistent with the
impatient haste of Davus.

V.-MOD0.

Although Modo does not present the same complications as Adeo,
we nevertheless find the discussions with regard to this word overlaid
with perplexing and useless distinctions and refinements.

The fact is that modo employed as an adverb has two, and not
more than two, separate meanings, which are represented in English by

I. ‘Only' or ‘provided only,’

ΙΙ. ‘Just now.’

These have no obvious connection, although in reality the second
is only a particular case of the first, but both flow directly and easily
from the proper signification of modus. We shall examine them>
separately.

Ι. fllode signifying ‘only' or ‘provided only,' The primitive
meaning of modus is ‘a measure,’ and hence ‘a definite quantity'
of any object* Thus modo conveys the idea of something definite,
bounded, and therefore limited; Most. I. iii. 43, Nihilo ego, quam
nunc tu, amata sum, atque unz‘ modo gessi morem, ‘ I devoted myself to
one person only,’ or, in other words, ‘I limited my affections to a
single lover;’ Pseud. I. iii. 30, Potin ut semel modo, Ballio, huc cum
lucro respicias, ‘ once only,' ‘limiting yourself to this single occasion ;'
ii. 88, T u aulem quae pro capite argentzmz mz'lzz' iam iamque saepe numeras,
Ea paczlrcz' modo πίε, sed quae pacta es non scc's solvere, ‘you know only
how to make a bargain, but do not know how to keep it‚’ ‘your
knowledge is limited to making a bargain 3' As. II. ii. 8, Aetatem velim
servire Libanum ut conveniam modo, ‘I would be content to remain
a slave for ever could Ι only meet Libanus,’ ‘provided only,’ ‘with
this limitation;' Phor. I. ii. 9, D. Quid z'stuc est τ’ G. Scies Modo ut
tacere possis, ‘ provided only,’ ‘with this limitati0n‚ that you can hold
your tongue3’ Cic. de Off. III. 19, ξ 77, Huic Igitur viro bono, quem
Fimbria etiam, non modo Socrates noverat, ‘ an acquaintance with whom
