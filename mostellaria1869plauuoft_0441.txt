whom they attach themselves: Epid. ΙΙ. iii. 6, Quod pol ego metuo, si
senex resciverit, lVe ulmos parasitos saciat quae usque adtondeant.

Sometimes they are pens, the back of the culprit being the
copy-book: Pseud. Ι. ν. 131, Quasi in libro quom scribuntur calamo
literae, Stulis me totum usque ulmeis conscrz'buo.

Sometimes they are catapults hurling darts and death: Pers. I. i.
28, Vide modo ulmeae catapultae tuum ne transfigant latus.

Sometimes the victim is a bottomless abyss of rods: Amph. IV.
ii. 9, Verbera, etiam quis ego sim me rogitas ,ν’ ulmorum Acheruns, Quem
pol ego hodie ob istaec dicta faciam ferventem flagris.

Sometimes he will absorb so many elm rods that he will be
changed into their substance: As. ΙΙ. ii. 96, Mihi tibique interminatus
est nosfuturos ulmeos.

Sometimes he is an anvil: Amph. Ι. i. 7, Quasi mcudem me miserum
homines octo validi caedunt .· ita Peregre adveniens hospitio publicitus
accipiar.

Sometimes he is a solid melted by the fervent heat engendered
by the rods: Cas. Π. vi. 48, Tu ut liquescas, lpse actutum virgzs
calefactabe7'e.

Sometimes he is a garden well watered by blows: Epid. I. ii. 18,
Quem quidem ego hominem z'nrzgralum plagis pistari dabo.

Sometimes he is a farmer who may look for an abundant vintage,
not of grapes but of rods—a rich harvest of missortune: Rud. III. ii.
21, At ego te per crura et talos tergumque optestor tuzcm, Si tibi ulmeam
uberem esse speras virgi (brutam, Et tibi eventurum lzoc anno uberem
messem mali, Vt . . . mihi dt'eas . . . διο.

Sometimes he is a (lebtor who defers the day os payment by
contracting fresh loans, with the certainty of having a heavier account
to settle eventually: Phor. V. ii. 15, Quid fiel Β in eodem luto haesitas .·
vorsura solves ³⁵, Geta, praesens quod ficerat malum in diem abiit,
plagae crescunt.

* Salmasius and Gronovius proved long ago that the mercantile term
versura denoted the expedient of paying off a debt by contracting a fresh
loan, the creditor being thus changed. But whenever a plan of this kind
is resorted to, the new loan must be equal to the sum originally borrowed,
together with the interest due upon it, so that, on each repetition of the
process, an addition is made to the debt, just as at the present day, when
a bill of exchange is renewed instead of being paid, the new bill must
always be for a larger sum than that for which it is substituted. Geta
having committed an offence which exposed him to punishment, staves off
the evil hour by a fresh piece of knavery, but by so doing the number of
stripes due by him is increased (plagae crescunt).

The technical phrase for renewing a loan in this manner is Versuram
facere, and hence Versum solvere means ‘to pay off an old loan by a new
