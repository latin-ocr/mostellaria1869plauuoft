pppidus, signifying ‘ abundant‚' to which oppidum, ‘ a town‚’ and oppido,
both belong, and that the true meaning of oppido is ‘abundantly,'
‚which we ourselves use as equivalent to ‘very‚' when we speak
of a matter as ‘abundantly clear,’ ‘evident‚’ ‘ridiculous‚' and so
forth. There is a very obscure passage in Quintilian VIII. 3, § 25,
with regard to this word; “Satis est vetus: quid necesse est, quaeso,
dicere oppido? quo sunt usi paululum tempore nostro superiores:
vereor ut iam nos ferat quisquam.” Are we to understand that Quin-
tilian here condemns altogether the use of the word oppido, or that he
merely disapproves of the use of oppido in the sense of saus, or does
he mean something different from either of these explanations?

52. Venit ignavia] i. e. ‘dissipation.¹ Ignavus is the opposite of
gnavus, ‘energetic‚' ‘ vigorous‚' ‘ active‚' ‘ strenuous‚’ and since idleness
is the mother of mischief, ignavia and ignavus are employed to
denote various phases of moral turpitude. Thus in our text tgr-navia
signifies profligacy, dissipation, extravagance3 and so in Trin. I. ii.
95, Megaronides bitterly reproaches Callicles with having given a
supply of money to Lesbonicus, Qui exaedtficaret suam inchoatam
tgnaviam, i. e. ‘build up to the summit the stmcture of his profli-
gacy already commenced ;' so too Poen. IV. ii. 24, where ignavus is
opposed to frugi bonae, ‘ respectable,' Proinde habet hic orationem quasi
ipse sit frugi bonae Qui ipsus hercle ignaviorem potis est facere ignaviam.
Ignavia signifies carelessness, want of activity, in Merc. 111. iv. 77.
In Ι. 2 3, Nusquam est disciplina ignavior, ‘ nowhere is household
discipline more lax.' The most common meaning is ‘worthless,
good-for-nothing3’ ille ignavos, ‘that profligate: Trin. 1. ii. 128;
zgnavom, ‘a coward‚’ Most. 111. ii. 169; tgnavi, ‘cowards in war‚'
.Capt. ΙΙ. ii. 123 mea ignavia, ‘thou that art the monument of my
soll)·,' Pers. V. ii. 68; is ignavissumus (in wrath), ‘that rascal,’ Poen.
V. v. 3: ignavi homines, ‘these rascals,' Rud. 111. v. 49; and so
tgnaz’is and ignavia, in Men. V. vi. 8, 11; rgnavi, ‘idle scoundrels’
(to slaves), Pseud. 1. ii. 1; ipsi ignave} ‘the worthless, good-for-.
nothing‚’ Bac. III. vi. 15, and me esse dicim tgnavissunzum, ‘call me
utterly worthless‚' v. ²7 ; ille ignavissumus, ‘that most worthless of·
men,' Trin. IV. ii. 81; and so homo tgna-russume, Men. V. v. 25;
rgnave, ‘you good-sor-nothing old profligate,' Cas. ΙΙ. iii. 233 igna-
vz'orem in the same sense, v. 28 ; and so ignavissumis vervecibus,
‘these good-for-nothing worn-out old wethers,¹ 111. ii. 4. Com-.
