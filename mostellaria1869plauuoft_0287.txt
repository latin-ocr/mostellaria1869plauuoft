NOTES. 1. ιι 58. 107

mactassz'nt malo‚· in Afranius (Privig. frag. XVI. ed. Ribbeck), Ah,
fulica, bene peristi, di te mactassint mal0,· and in Pomponius (Praeco
post. frag. V. ed. Ribbeck), At te dz' omnes cum consilto, calve, mac-
tassz'nt malo. Occasionally we find a play upon the double meaning
of macto, as in Novius (Gallinaria frag. III. ed. Ribbeck), where the
speaker is addressing some deity, Maelo te his verbenis, macta tu illanc
z’nfhrtunzb‚· and in Plaut. Amph. IV. ii. 14, M. Sacrufico ego tibi.
A. Qui? M. Quia enim te macto irgfortum'o. 4. Nonius, who enlarges
on the different meanings of macto, and quotes a great number of the
' passages adduced above, adds yet another signification, praecipitare,
which may be connected with the preceding as denoting ‘to consign
to destruction ;’ he gives as his authority a passage from Accius
(Antenoridae frag. V. ed. Ribbeck), quz' aut illorum copias Fundam
in camp0, aut navis uram, aut castra mactabo z'n mare.

The use of mactus is peculiar. It is generally employed in the voca-
tive singular, macte, and when a deity is addressed signifies, ‘be thou
honoured or glorified ;' examples are common in Cato de R. R. Thus
(cap. 132), Iupiter dapalis . . . macte lzac illace dape pollucenda esto . . .
macte vino inferio est0,· again (cap. 134), Iupiter, mactefircto esto; and
(cap. 141), Mars pater. . macte lzt's suovetaurilibus lactentibus esto.
When macte is addressed to a human being it is generally coupled
with virtute* or some word expressing a good quality, and is a sort
of complimentary formula implying a prayer that the person addressed
may prosper and make constant additions to his stock of worth.
That mactus implies the notion of making honourable additions to
what we possess is seen in a line quoted from Lucilius by Serv. on
Virg. AEn. IX. 641, Macte, inquam, virtute simulque lu‘s versibus esto.
In the passage in the AEn. we have sllacte nova virtute, puer, sic z'tur ad
astra,· and Liv. X. 40, T u quidem macte virtute dz'lzgrentzaque est0,· in the
line of Accius (Neoptol. frag. IX. ed. Ribbeck), Tu, uti dz'xt, macte
his armzk, macta virtutem palrzlr, macta must mean simply ‘ add to' or
‘transcend' Occasionally, we find macti in the vocative plural, as
in Liv. VII. 36, fllacti virtute, inquit, milites Romani, este. Lastly‚ but
rarely, mactus is employed to mean ‘loaded,' ‘overwhelmed,' ‘hard
pressed‚’ ‘violently assailed ;' in Lucret. V. 1339, Vt nunc saepe boves
Lucae ferro male mactae Dgffugz'unt,fira sata suis cum multa dedere ‚·

* In the later writers macte is followed by a genitive, e. g. Mart. XII.
vi. 7, Macte animi, quem rarus habet, morumque tuorum Quos Numa quos hilaris
posset habere Cato. And so Stat. Theb. 11. 495. In these cases some
might consider bonis or some equivalent word understood, which is actually

expressed in Stat. Sil. 1. iii. 106.
