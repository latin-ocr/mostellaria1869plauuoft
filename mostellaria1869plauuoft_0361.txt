EXCVRSVS.

1.—A ΠΕΟ.

This word, as exhibited in some of our best dictionaries, presents
“ a somewhat formidable aspect. In that of Freund, for example, what
with classifications and divisions and subdivisions‚ the meanings are
distributed under seventeen or eighteen heads, and no pains have
been taken to connect them by a common bond. Let us endeavour
to simplify the matter.

It cannot reasonably be doubted that adeo is compounded of ad
and Aeo. The Roman grammarians, while admitting this etymology,
were embarrassed by the consideration that ad, a preposition govern-
ing the accusative, should be followed by an ablative co. Thus Paulus
Diaconus s. v., p. 19, ed. Mun„ while distinguishing adeo the verb from
adeo the adverb, remarks with regard to the latter--“ idem (significat)
quod usque eo, non quidem secundum rationem, quia ad praepositio
accusativis accommodata est, sed vetusta quadam loquendi consuetu-
dine”—a practice, as Miiller observes, similar to that which prevails in
the words praeterea, propterea, 'hacpropler, quoad, αᾱᾳιιοῇ &c. Avoiding
all etymological speculations as to the form e0, but taking it for
granted that adeo is made up of ad and e0, it will be necessary, in the
first place, to examine the meanings of σο. These, although at first
sightvarious, may all be reduced to two.

Ι. Eo signifying ‘to that.'

II. Eo signifying ‘by that’

Ι. Eo signifying ‘to that' is used directly with reference to'place
in such phrases as eo se recipere coeperunt, i. e. ‘they began to betake
themselves thither (to that place) ;' and so eo pervenire, eo reverlz', &c.
—it is used with reference to time in eo usque me vivere vullz's donec,-
eone usque dum ea nascantur ad Casilinum sessurus sum—it is used
