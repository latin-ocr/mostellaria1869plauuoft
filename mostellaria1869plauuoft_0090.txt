liv PROLEGOMENA.

What we propose at present is to examine—

Ι. Those kinds of verse employed by the dramatists, with regard
to the existence and general structure of which no reasonable doubts
can be entertained.

ΙΙ. The prosody of Plautus and Terence, in so far as it is really
or apparently at variance with that with which we are familiar in the
works os the Latin poets from Lucretius downwards.

It may be urged that this is not the natural and logical arrange-
ment of the subject—that a knowledge of the prosody ought to
precede an inquiry into the versification. But in practice the plan
we have indicated will prove the more convenient. We can find
numerous examples which will enable those acquainted with the
prosody of the Augustan age to comprehend the structure of the
different verses of which we treat; and when we have acquired a
general knowledge of these, we shall be enabled to discuss those
particular cases in which the scansion is apparently difficult or
anomalous.

We Iambz'c Trimeter Acalaleclic

is the principle vehicle for the dialogue os Latin comedy, when it is
carried on in a calm, unimpassioned tone. Priscian, in his treatise
De metris Cornicis, asserts that the Iambus, the Tribrach, the Spon-
dee, the Anapaest‚ and the Dactyl‚ are employed “indifferenter''
in all the places of the Cornic Iambic Trimeter except the last,
which is reserved sor the Iambus exclusively, and this statement is
sully borne out by the works of Plautus and Terence. It must not
however be supposed that such lines as

sz're lu patulae recubans sub Agmine piri,
Castaneasque nuces mea quas Amaffllt's Ιιαόῑῑίί,
Huic com'ux &chucus erat dz’tz'sn'mus agri

could be recognised, although not directly incompatible with the
above rule, any more than that

Κατάβα, κατάβα, κατάβα, κατάβα, καταβήσομαι,
could be accepted as a fair specimen of an Aristophanic Trimeter.
The Latin poets always contrive to preserve the Iambic rhythm‚ and
although Anapaests and Dactyls are not excluded from any one os the

first five places, they are used more sparingly than Spondees, and not
strung together in an unbroken series in the same line. The Dactyl
