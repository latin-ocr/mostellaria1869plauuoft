⁴ subject or theme of a discussion,’ and thus argumentum is used
specially for the ‘ plot or story of a drama.’ Thus Amph. Prol. 51, 96,
Post argumentum huius eloquar tragoediae ,· and Trin. III. ii. 81, Facile
palmam haben hic victus. Vicit tua comoedia Hic agit magis ex argu-
mento et versus meliores facit, i. e. ‘ he keeps more closely to the story ;’
hence, in a still more general sense, argumentum signifies the repre-
sentation of story in a work of art. Thus Virgil calls the representation
of the story of Io on the shield of Turnus, argumentum zngens; and
Cicero Verr. Act. II. iv. 56, when describing the famous doors of
the Temple of Minerva in the Insula at Syracuse, Ex ebore diligentissime
perfecta argumenta erant z'n valvis. We have argumentari in the Vulg.
of Truc. IV. ii. 2 3, but the reading is more than doubtful. Examples
of argumentum, in the sense of ‘reasonings,’ ‘proofs,' ‘arguments,' may
be found in Amph. I. i. 267, 277, II. i. 45, ΙΙ. ii. 174, V. i. 35;

5. Similis] with genitive. So in vv. 5, 8, 38 (35), 47 (43).

7. Id reperi iam exemplum] The modifications of meaning which
exemplum undergoes are worthy of attention. There can be little
doubt that exemplum is derived, like eximius, from eximo, and it seems
properly to signify an object picked out or selected from others of the
same kind on account of its excellence. Hence it means ‘ a model‚'
something set up to be copied or imitated. Of this meaning we have
an instance a few lines lower down v. 21 (19), inde exemplum expetunt,
and again, III. ii. 75, 76, 86 (73, 74, 84). Hence figuratively, Men.
V. vi. 27, Eo exemplo servio, tergi ut in rem esse arbitror, i. e. ‘keeping
the interest of my hide steadily in view,y as an artist who copies from
a model; and Bac. ΙΙΙ. vi. 11, Multi more isto atque exemplo vivont,
i. e. ‘making that manner of lise their model.' Hence in Trin. IV.
ii. 76, Charmides, when endeavouring to bring a name to the recol-
lection of the Sycophanta, Quod ad exemplum est) coniectura si
reperire possumus. S. Ad hoc exemplum est, Char. C. An Chares Β
Αη Charidemus. An Charmides? i. e. ‘What is it like? . . . It is like
Char! Moreover exemplum may be used in a bad as well as in a
good sense, and may signify an object selected not as a model but
as a warning to others, as we talk in English of making an example
