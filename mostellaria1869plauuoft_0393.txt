EXCVRSVS VL-NAM, ENIM, ὧι. 205

. . . sometimes z' so Eun. IV. iv. 47, modo ait, modo negat, ‘at one
moment he says “yes‚'' and the next moment he says “nol'' In
the poets and later writers various adverbs are substituted for the
second modo, such as nunc, aliquando, interdum, ac statim, saepe, non-
numquam, rursus, &c.‚ but these constructions are hardly to be found

in the dramatic writers.

Every one has felt that in animated conversation or eager discussion
the thoughts of a speaker not unfrequently outstrip the powers of
utterance, and hence single words or even whole clauses are sup-

pressed‚ and must be supplied by the hearer.
The same thing happens in vehement declamation‚ sometimes

unintentionally and sometimes designedly on the part of the orator,
and, generally, such an omission may naturally take place whenever
a speaker is, or wishes to appear to be, under the influence of great
eagerness or strong passion. The words which indicate a chasm of
this kind, in the dramatic miters, are for the most part nam and
enim, which serve to introduce an explanation of some difficulty
suggested by what goes before, although the connecting link must
often be mentally supplied.

I. Nam. Amph. Prol. 104. Mercmy, in the Prologue to the Am-
phitruo, seeks to startle the audience by announcing that Jupiter will
appear in person on the stage, and take part in the action of the play.
He then informs them that the scene is laid in Thebes, proceeds to
give an account of Amphitruo and Alcumena, and tells us how the
former had some time previously gone forth in command of the Theban
army to war against the Teleboans: Is (sc. Amphitruo) priusquam
hinc abiit ipsemet in exercitum, Gravidam Alcumenam uxorem fecit suam.
Nam ego vos novisse credo iam ut sil paler meus, Quam liber harum rerum
multarum siet, Quantasque amator quom quid complacitum esl {semel .· Is
amare occepit Alcumenam clam virum—where the nam is2introduced
most abruptly, and we must supply the train of thought somewhat
after this sashion: ‘having mentioned the beautiful Alcumena, you
will no longer feel any surprise that Jupiter should be mixed up with
this business, for, Ι doubt not, you are all by this time well aware of
what sort of person my father is‚' &c.; Truc. IV. iv. 3, Blitea et lutea

madeant, cor sil saltem sobrium. lVam mz'lzz' dz'zvz‘dz'ajest, lonslrt'cem meam
