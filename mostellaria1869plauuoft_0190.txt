CA. Advorsum venire mihi ad Philolachem
Volo temperi: audi: hem, tibi imperatum est.
Nam illi, ubi fui, inde effugi foras:
Ita me ibi male convivii sermonisque taesum est.
Nunc commissatum ibo ad Philolachetem, 5
Vbi nos hilari ingenio et lepide accipiet.
Ecquid tibi videor, ma-ma-madere?

In the following Scene, more than the usual amount of confusion exists
in the different MSS. and edd. in regard to the distribution of the dialogue
among the characters. We have, for the most part, adhered to the
vulgate. Hermann, Ritschl, and XVeise, differ as to the metrica] consti-
tution of the passage, and each introduces changes in order to suit his
own views. W⁷e have closely followed the division into lines found in B,
except in one instance, and have adhered to the text of that MS„ except

where it was obviously corrupt.

1. venire, so> the MSS. veniri RW and others. The i in venire a
correction of c. The fourth letter corrected and blurred.

2. temperi, so the MSS. tempori Vulg. audi hem-audiem CD.
In Ba very doubtful. The word is corrected and blurred in the fourth
letter. audi em Bb. Apparently in B the em was placed at first too near
to the audi and a mark was made by the first hand thus, azzdiAem, to shew

they were distinct words, tibi imperatum est the MSS. tibist im-
persstu'iilff‘so the MSS. mic Camer.v111g.w. fui, so Camer. fuit
tbi-Mai. ibi male CDFZ. ibi is omitted in B, being written above by c
or a late hand. taesum est, so Pareus. tesunt D. In B there is a

sort of dash or stroke at the end of the word, 50, Tenui} it is probably
intended for Taum. In iv. 1. 17 (873) the m is written in exactly the
same way, where R reads sum—sunt seems better. te sunt C. cesunt F Z.
5. Philolachem R against the MSS.
6. hilari, so the Mss. hilaro W. et lepide, so Camer. The line

appears thus in Β- ι l

t ( c
Vbi nos ilari ingenio elepida accipia.
The t in red ink. elcpida CDa. R has et lepido [victu] accipiet.

7, 8. ln B these two form a single line.

7. Ecquid FZ. Hecquid BD, so necquis, v. 26. Hec quid C. Ecquid
Bb. In B the first letter is erased, probably N or H. ma-ma-nmdere,
so Both. R. The MSS. have mammam adire. Scaliger introduced
mamma madere, and so Vulg. W.
