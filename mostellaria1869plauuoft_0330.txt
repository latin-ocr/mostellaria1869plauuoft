1 48 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

dictum Capitol a capite, quod Sacerdotulae in capite etiam nunc solent
habere‚'' Varro L. L. V. ξ 130, ed. Mull. (iv. 29) 3 and so Paul. Diae.
p. 57, ed. Mun„ “ Capitol linteum quoddam quo in sacrificiis utebantur.''
2. with facinus understood, Paul. Diae. p. 48, “Cczpz'tczl, facinus quod
capitis poena luitur.'' Plautus has it twice; Men. Ι. i. 16, qumquam
edepol fugiet, tametsi capital fecerit ,· and Merc. IV. iv. 26, C. Eutuche
capital factis. E. Qui:2 C. Quia aequalem et sodalem, civem liberum,
enicas. See also Lucil. ap. Non. s. v. capital, 1. 175 (p. 38).

In the passage now before us, Weise, following the Ed. Prin. in
opposition to the best MSS„ reads capitalis aedis sacta est, which
he explains, “Capitalis autern hic est, propter crimen in ea commis-
sum quasi interdicta,’' but he adduces no authority for such a meaning
of capitalis. We find indeed in Paul. Diac. p. 66, ed. Mun„ “Capitalis
lucus, ubi, si quid violatum est, caput violatoris expiatur,’' but this can
have no place here.

57. In the well known passage in Virgil G. I. 2o3‚ Non aliter
quam qui, &c.‚ Aulus Gellius (X. 29) and Servius (ad. loc.) agree that
atque is equivalent to statim, and in the line now before us scholars
propose to translate atque by ‘forthwith.' I do not however see that
this is necessary, and would render it simply ‘and then‚’ i. e. ‘the
next thing that happened was! There are however several passages
in Plautus where the latter of two events connected by atque is repre-
sented as following so immediately upon the former that the conjunc·
tion may fairly be translated ‘forthwith;' thus Bac. ΙΙ. iii. 45, Dum
circumspecto, atque ego lembum conspz'cor,· Epid. 11. ii. 33, Quom ad
pestum vent‘c), atque ego illam illic video praestolarier; Merc. II. iii. 17,
N unc si dico, ut res est, atque illam mihi me Emt'sse indico, quemadmodum
existumet me? Atque illam apstralzat‚ trans mare hinc venum asportet ,·
Capt. III. i. 19, Salvete inquam, Quo imus una, inquam, ad prandium?
atque illi taccnt; to which we may add Merc. 11. iii. 17, i. 35 ; Trin.
111. ii. 433 but scarcely Poen. ΙΙΙ. iii. 38. In Cas. Prol. 48 at seems
to be equivalent to statz‘m3 and in Amph. 111. ii. 74 atque is most
conveniently translated by ‘but.’

62. Illirum quin vzssgz'lantz‘ diceret] ‘It is wonderful that the
man who was murdered sixty years ago did not tell his tale to my
master when wide awake,' the force being ‘ It is a very likely story, is
it not, that (the ghost of) a man who was murdered sixty years ago
would tell his tale to one who was wide awake 1' Illz'rum quin implies
strong irony, and is employed to evince the impatient contempt felt
by the speaker for some statement or observation made or implied
by the person with whom he is conversing. Thus Amph. 11. ii. 1 18,
