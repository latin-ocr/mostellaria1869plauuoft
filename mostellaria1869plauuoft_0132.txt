xc PROLEGOMENA.

where it is to be observed that elision is neglected in the division of
the verse after laevo. Nonius, p. 103, refers to this very line: “Ex-
pape'llato brachio, quasi usque ad papillam renudato. Plautus Milite
glorioso: id, connexum in numero levo, expapz'llato brachiost' and the
expression expapillato brachio is acknowledged by Paul. Diac.‚ p. 79:
“Expapsllato brachio, exserto: quod quum fit, papilla nudatur.''
But on the other hand expapillato appears in not one of the best
MSS„ all of which seem to have had exfafillato bractam, and this in
one of the interpolated family appears as expallz'ato brachio. More-
over, Paul. Diac., p. 83, has, “Effafilatum‚ exsertum, quod scilicet
omnes exserto brachio sint exfilatz', id est, extra vestimentum filo
contextum.’'

Now while we are free to repudiate the etymological explanation,
we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that there existed a phrase,
effafilalo brachio, which was equivalent to exserto brachio, and it seems
highly probable that the word effafilato, having become obsolete at
an early period, was explained by grammarians by the more obviously
intelligible expapillato, and thus the latter found its way into the text.
It would be contrary to the natural and usual process to suppose
that expapzttato, with regard to the force of which there would be no
doubt, would be changed into the forgotten effafilato. The conjecture
of O. Miiller, that fafila in old Latin was equivalent to fibula, is very
plausible ; reading therefore,

Id connexum z'n humero laevo effafilato brachio,
we can scan the line without difficulty, supposing the quantity of the
verb to be either sdfilo or feifa& the meaning will clearly be, ‘ The

arm being thrust out beyond (or below) the buckle.'
Again, with the word satellites. This word is found in Mil. I. 78,

with its proper quantity,
Age eamus ergo—Sequimini, satellites,

but R. is disposed to allow the second vowel to remain short before
the double lt, and pronounce satellites, relying on Trin. IV. i. 14,
one of a series of Trochaic Tetrameters Acatalectic. He prints—

Dz'straxz'ssent disque tulissent satellites tuz' miserum foede,

whereas all the MSS. have—-
Dz‘straxz'ssent dz'sque tulissent satellites tui me miserum finde,

and me seems to be required by the idiom of the language. Under
this shape the line is impracticable, and hence Hermann reads——

‚DaelvlraA-sssmt dalvquc tulzivsml tue‘ satellites mc sbcde,
