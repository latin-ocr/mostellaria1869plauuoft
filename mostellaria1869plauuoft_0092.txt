lvi PROLEGOMENA.

Spondee and the Anapaest from the 4th place, but Hermann, while
he admits the canon when the division of the verse is observed‚
considers that when the division is not observed, the Spondee, the
Anapaest‚ and even the DactyL are all admissible.

In so far as the 7th foot is concerned, the Latins admit freely
the proper foot, the Tribrach‚ the Spondee, and the Dactyl‚ the Aua-
paest more rarely, and generally include it in a single word.

Finally, this verse is Asynartete, and therefore the last syllable of
the 4th foot may be either long or short, and the hiatus in this
place is freely permitted.

According to what has been said above, the scheme of the Iambic
Tetr. Cat. will be as follows :—

 

 

 

 

 

 

υ- υ- υ- υ- υ- υ- υ- Ξ·
υυυ &JK-JV &dvm υυυ υυυ υυυ mxlv
-υυ -υυι-υυέ-υυ -υυ -υυ -υυς

We shall give a few specimens to illustrate the varieties os struc-
ture indicated above, selecting our examples from the Mostellaria,
in which the lines at the' commencement of Ι. iii. (1—90) are com-
posed in this measure :—

1. iii. 1, regular,

Iampridem ecastor frzgz‘da Ι non lav? magi' lubenter.
v. 2, Asynartete, and Spondee in 7th‚
Nec quom me melius, mea Scapha, ΙΙ rear esse defaecatam.
v. 3, Spondee in 7th‚ but not necessarily,
Eventus rebus omnibus, Ι velut horno messis magna.
v. 6, Asynartete,
Haec z'lla est tempestas mea, ΙΙ mihi quae modestiam omnem.
v. 7, regular,
Detexit tectus qua sui, Ι quam mz'hz' Amor et Cupido.
v. 8, regular,
In pectus perpluit meum, Ι neque iam umquam optegere possum.
zv. 9, regular,
Madent iam in corde parietes Ι .· periere haec oppido aedes.
v. 10, Asynartete and Dactyl in 7th‚

Contempla amabo, mea Scapha, Η satin hacc me vestis deceat.
