62. saginam caedite] This expression is very embarrassing. Let
us first examine the meaning of the word sagina. In the writers upon
rural affairs it signifies the act or process of fattening domestic animals.*
Thus Varro R. R. III. 10 says that five points must be attended to
in the management of geese—de genere, de fetura, de ovis, de pullis, de
sagina, i. e. ‘the breed‚' ‘ the propagation,' ‘the eggs,’ ‘the goslings‚’ and
‘the process of fattening ;' and Columella VIII. 14 tells us that when
the goslings are four months old the largest are to be selected and set
aside sor fattening, farlurae maximus quisque destinatum· and then
goes on, et est facilis harum avium sagina, i. e. ‘ the process of fattening
these birds is easy;' so also Plin. H. N. IX. 56, ξ 82 informs us, on
the authority of Varro, that Fulvius Lupinus, a short time before the
civil war, was the first who kept snails in a preserve (coclearum vivaria
instituit), and proceeds, quin el saginam earum commentus esl sapa el
farre aliisque generibus, διο. In the above passages the word sagina
denotes the ‘ art’ or ‘ process of fattening,’ and hence it easily
passed into the signification found in Tacitus, Juvenal, δια, of the
‘materials used for fattening‚' ‘ nourishing, rich food,’ and hence ‘food'
in general. This use is not, however, confined to the writers who

'¹‘ Gesner, in his Index to the R. R. Scriptores, would connect the word
with the Greek verb σάττω.
