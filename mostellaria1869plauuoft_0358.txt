1 74 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

p. 77, presents the words under the form of belo: “Betere, id est,
ire :'' and quotes from Varro, mulierem foras bctere iussit ‚· and from
Pacuvius, si ire conor, prohibet betere. There is a second quotation
from Pacuvius, but it is so corrupt as not to be available. Etymo·
logists would connect bilo or belo with βῆμι βαίνω, etc.

37. lVescis quam meticulosa res sil ire ad iudicem] llIeltculosus,
‘full of sear‚' from metus. The word is found again in Amph. Ι. i.
137, Nullus est hoc meticulosus aeque‚· and reappears in the writings
of Apuleius Florid. I. 2, ξ 2. Observe that in the Most. the word
signifies ‘causing fear‚’ in the Amph. ‘feeling fear,’ in Apuleius it
is applied as an epithet of the hare (leporem meticulosum).

V. iii. 1. Vbi somnum sepelivi omnem atque obdormivi crapulam]
Crapula, which is identical with the Greek κραιπάλη, signifies properly
the headache and nausea which follow a drunken debauch. Plautus
employs it again in Pseud. V. i. 35 and in Rud. II. vii. 28: in the
latter passage we read, Quin abeo hinc in Veneris fanum, ul edormiscam
hanc crapulam, whence many edd. substitute edormivi for obdormivi in
our text. Crapula is found also in Cicero, Livy, and Pliny. The
adjective crapularius appears in Stich. I. iii. 74, Vel unctiones Graecas
sudatorias Vendo, vel alias malacas crapularias .·* crapulenlus and
crapulosus occur in late writers only.

9. De cena facio gratiam] i. e. ‘ thank you, excuse me.' This was
the formula when a person wished politely to decline an invitation,
and is exactly represented by the French je vous remercie and the
Italian grazia, which, when used in reply to an offer or invitation,
always signify ‘no, I thank you.' The phrase is varied in Men. ΙΙ.
iii. 36, E. Eamus intro, ut prandeamus. ΑΙ. Bene vocas: lam gratia
est, i. e. ‘you are very kind’-‘ (Ι must decline, but) I am obliged to
you all the same ;' and so again in Stich. 111. ii. 17, Cenabis apud me,
quoniam salvos advenis. E. Vocala est opera nunc quidem: lam gratia
est, ‘I am engaged, but Ι am obliged to you all the same;' in Trin.
ΙΙ. ii. 14, Hi mores maiorum laudant, Eosdem lululant, quos collaudant,
hisce ego le arlibus gratiam Facio, neu colas, neu imbuas ingenium:
i. e. ‘srorn following such practices I excuse you.'

23. enim istic captio est.] Enim here indicates an aposiopesis.
We must supply, ‘no, I thank you, for there is fraud in that pro-
posal of yours.' The same words occur in the same sense in Epid.
V. ii. 36. For the word Caplio see note on IV. ii. 19.

* This at least is the reading of the Ambrosian Palimpsest. BCD have
vel alias mala castra pullarius.
