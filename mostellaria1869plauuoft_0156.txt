while in Plautus they have the first syllable generally long, e.g. Most.
II. ii. 67 (Senar.),

lVam me Acheruntem recipere Orcus noluit ;
Mil. ΙΙΙ. i. 32 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚
Quid ais tu? itane tibi ego videor oppido Acherunticus!²

Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 93 (Senar.),

Censetur censu ad Acheruntem mortuos.

See also Amph. IV. ii. 9, V. i. 29, Capt. ΙΙΙ. ν. 31, V. iv. 1, 2,
Cas. II. viii. 12, Bac. II. ii. 21, Mere. II. ii. 19, ΙΙΙ. iv. 21, Trin. II.
iv. 124, Poen. I. iii. 22, Truc. IV. ii. 40.

We have said that the first syllable is generally long in Plautus,
for two or three examples are quoted in which it is said to be short.
But of these there is only one which will not bear examination.
This is Most. ΙΙ. ii. 76,

Vz'vom me arcessunt ad Acheruntem mortui,

where all the best MSS. have the ad, which however might very
readily have been interpolated by a transcriber, and be omitted
without injury to the construction, and it is singular that the poet
should have made the first syllable of Acheruntem long in v. 67
and short in v. 76. Three other examples are quoted from the

Poenulus—Prol. 71 (Senar.), Ι. ii. 131 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚ IV. ii. 9
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

1. Ipse abiit ad Acheruntem sine viatico.
2. Quo die Orcus ab Acherunte mortuos amiserit.
3. Quodvis genus ibi hominum videas, quasi Acheruntem venerzs.

But in the first example, an Anapaest in the second place of the
Senarian is perfectly admissible;* in the second, we may consider
the 2nd foot to be a Dactyl; in the third, quasi, as elsewhere, may
be pronouneed as a monosyllable and totally elided. And yet the
evidence afforded of the quantity of Acheruns in these three lines
is considered by Weise sufficient to prove that the whole play is
spurious! The evidence therefore for Acheruns in Plautus rests on
the line of the Mostellaria alone, which, as we have pointed out
above, is suspicious and easily corrected.

²⁸ [Is an Anapaest admissible in the second place after a Dactyl? Would
it not be simpler to omit the ad, as suggested in reference to the passage
quoted from Most. 11. ii. 76? Spengel would read abit for abun—En]
