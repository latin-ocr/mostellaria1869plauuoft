antecedent to qui is cistellam cum crepundiis (v. 4 3), or simply ct'stellam

preceding examples, it may be held that quizut, ‘in order that.'

Quin occurs perpetually in the dramatic writers, and modifies the
clauses with which it is combined in so many different ways that it
demands close attention. We may perhaps class the different mean-
ings under three heads. Of these, two are simple and distinct, but
the third is somewhat complicated.

1. Quin is employed in direct interrogations, in which case it is
followed by the indicative, and is equivalent to cur non. We may
fairly regard quin here as representing qui non or qut ne. (On qua
see preceding Excursus.) Quin is not unfrequently followed by the
second person of the imperative, but in this case it has in reality
the force of a direct interrogation, as we shall point out below.

2. Quin is employed in negative propositions‚ or in propositions
in which a negation is implied, as equivalent to ut non, and is followed
by the subjunctive. Here quin, in most cases, represents qui non,
i. e. ul is non.

3. Quin is employed very frequently in dialogue to introduce an
explanation of some statement or remark made previously, either by
the speaker himself or by the person with whom he is conversing.
It must be borne in mind that a speaker may repeat the remark of
another in different words, for the purpose of ascertaining that he
has correctly understood the remark in question, seeking an ex-
planation, as it were; or he may repeat a remark previously made
by himself, for the purpose. of making his meaning more clear, thus
giving an explanation, and all this may be done without emotion,
or with an expression of anger or of impatience‚ and the emotion may
in man)¹ cases bc indicated by the tone of the speaker, and hence not
