lxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

employed in our own language, and the corresponding Latin term
Accenlus by several continental writers. In popular language the
terms Quanti-ly, Accent, and Emphasz's, although perfectly distinct,
are frequently confounded, but all who employ precise and scientific
language understand that Accent applies only to that elevation or
depression of tone which correspond to what are termed high and
low notes in music. It is by the proper application of accent that
we prevent reading or recitation from becoming monotonous, but
this has no necessary connection whatever with the quantity of a
syllable, which depends solely on the time that the voice dwells
upon it in comparison with other syllables.

But while several modern grammarians have vainly imagined that
the quantity of a syllable might be influenced by the aecem, Bentley
introduced fresh complications and fell into the strange mistake of
confounding the Acute Accent with the Ictus Metrius, which has by
some writers been most unfortunately termed the Metrzkal Accent.
This phrase, Ictus fllelrz‘cus, it is now universally admitted, was em-
ployed by grammarians to denote the stress which must be laid upon
certain syllables in repeating verse in order that the rhythm of the
measure may be made perceptible to the ear. In Dactylic verse
the Ictus falls upon the first syllable of the Dactyl and of the Spondee;
in Iambic verse, on the long syllable of the Iambus and the second
syllable of the Spondee; in Trochaic verse, on the long syllable of
the Trochee and the first syllable of the Spondee. When feet are
resoIved, the Ictus maintains its place, and hence in Iambic verse the
Ictus falls on the second syllable of the Tribrach‚ the second syllable
of the Dactyl, and the last syllable of the Anapaest ; in Trochaic verse,
on the first syllable of the Tribrach‚ the Dactyl, and the Anapaest.
That the Ictus Metricus has not in itself any connection with quantity
is evident from what has been stated above, that it falls according to
the verse, sometimes upon the first and sometimes on the second
syllable of the Spondee, on the first or second of the Dactyl, and on
the first or second of the Tribrach. Of the two syllables of the
Spondee, which are, in so far as quantity is concerned, equally long,
the first receives the Ictus in Dactylic verse, and the second in Iambic
verse, while one of the short syllables of the Dactyl has the Ictus in
Iambics, and one of the short syllables of the Anapaest in Trochaics.
That it has no connection with the Acute Accent or Accent proper
is equally evident from the fact that in polysyllables the Acute Accent
can fall only on the penultimate or antepenultimate, while in innu-
merable instances the Ictus must fall upon the last syllable. Bentley
