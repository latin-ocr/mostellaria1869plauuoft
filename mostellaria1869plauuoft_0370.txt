extravagance, (therefore) do not you now imagine that you are ables*
Eho dum dt'c mihi, ‘hearken now, tell mess in Eun. II. iii. 68; Andr.
ΙΙΙ. v. 10. Vix dum is ‘scarcely now! Dum in t'nterdum belongs
rather to the next head, ‘between whileS‚' &c.

II. Dum signifying ‘while'

The meaning of ‘ while’ is variously modified.

1. ‘While’ osten signifies ‘at the time when‚' ‘during the time that ;’
thus in English, ‘ while you are reading Ι shall take a wall< ς’ Andr. Ι.
ν. 31, Dum in dubio est animus, paulo momento huc vel illuc inpellitur,
‘while (at the time when) the mind is in a state os hesitation ;' Eun. ΙΙ.
iii. 49, Dum haec dt'ct'l, abitt hortu rogo num quid velit, ‘while (during
the time that) he was saying these things, time slipped away;' Epid.
III. iv, 6 5, Conducta reni ut fidibus cantarem seni Dum rem divinam
faceret, ‘while (during the time that) he might be offering sacrifice ;’
and so Pseud. V. i. 33, dum em'tor.

2. ‘While’ is employed when an event is represented as resulting
from the time spent or pains bestowed in doing something else: thus
in English, ‘while attending to the affairs os others Ι sacrificed my
own interests,’ where ‘while’ implies ‘in consequence of ’ or ‘in con-
sequence of the time I spent ;’ Andr. V. i. 3, Dum studeo ops-equi tibi,
paene inlusi vitam filiam· Adel. V. vii. 1, Occidunt me quidem dum m‘mt's
sanctas nuptias Student βαι-ενα· Phor. I. ii. 26, Seni fidelis dum sum,
scapulas perdzdz',· V. ii. 2, A'ostmpte culpa jacemus, ut malos expediat
esse, Dum nimium dici nos bonos studemus et bemgrnos.

3. ‘While’ meaning ‘till' or ‘until' Whether we accept or reject
the etymology of Horne Tooke‚ who regards till as to while, and
until as unto while, there can be no doubt that in the earlier forms
of our language ‘while' was used as equivalent—to ‘until :' thus, The-n
he commanded her to be bounden to a zcylde horse tayle ly the here
(gf her hedde, and so to be drawen whyle she was dede; and in some
provincial dialects such phrases as I will stay while evem'ng are said
to be still current.† For instances os dum in this signification, see

herum dum veniat ‚· Trin. I. ii. 133, Lupus opservavz't dum dormitaret
canes,· Eun. ΙΙΙ. iii. 28, At tu apud nos hic mane Dum redeat 2'psa;
Andr. II. i. 28, Saltem alz'quot dies Prqfer, dum prqficz'scor aliquo, ne
