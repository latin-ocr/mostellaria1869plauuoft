236 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

nimio is not an adverb, but the ablative of nimius with argento or
some such word understood, ‘the house does not appear to you to
have been purchased at too long a price, does it?’

,Nimio used as an adverb seems not to occur in Terence.

XIII.—-SODES, SIS pl. SVLTIS, AMABO, QVAESO,
OBSECRO.

These five words are employed by the dramatists in the sense of
‘pray,’ ‘prithee‚' ‘if you please,' ‘I beg of you,' ‘I beseech you‚'‚
‘ Ι implore you.’ We may make a few remarks upon each.

I. Sedes was regarded by the Romans themselves as a con-
traction of si audes: thus Cic. Orat. XLV. ξ 154, Libenter etiam
copulando verba iungebam, ul ‘sodes ⁷ pro ‘si audesss ‘ szlr ' pro ‘st‘ vlits
and Festus, s.v. sullis, p. 343, ed. Mun„ “Szcltzzv, si voltis significat,
composito vocabulo, ita ut alia sunt, sodes, slaudcs, sis, si vz's‚' &c.

The uncontracted form is found Trin. 11. i. 17, Da mihi hoc, mel
meum, sime amas, sz‘audes,· and in Aul. ΙΙ. i. 48, as the line is quoted
by Priscian, p. 960. ed. Puts„ Dic mz'lzz', si audes, quis ea est quam vti*
ducere uxorem ,θ where however our MSS. of Plautus give quaeso
instead of si audes.

Generally speaking, sodes is used without much emphasis: thus
Bac. IV. vii. 39, C. lVovz'sle'ne hominene ἓ N. Novi. C. Dic sodes
mihi, Bellan’ vz'delur specie mulier ,Ρ N. Admodum, i. e. ‘ pray, tell me,’
or ‘tell me, if you please ;' and so Men. ΙΙΙ. ἰίἰ. 21, Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 161,
Pers. II. v. 17.

It is a formula of civility in Hec. V. i. 27, sed scin quid volo polius
sodes facias? i. e. ‘if it so please you;' and so Heaut. IV. iv. 16,
Phor. V. vii. 28.

There is considerable earnestness in Adel. IV. v. 9, de'c sodes,
pater, ‘tell me, I entreat you;⁷ and in Hec. V. iv. 1, Vide, mi Par·
meno, eliam sodes, i. e. ‘pray, be caresul;' while there is something
soothing or deprecatory in Phor. V. iii. 10, Parce sodes,· and coaxing
in Poen. III. ν. 12, Mz‘tte ad me sodes, δια, and in Trin. ΙΙ. i. 17.
For other examples of sodes see Adel. IV. i. 1, Andr. I. i. 58,
Heaut. III. i. 50, iii. 19, IV. iv. 16, v. 22, Hec. III. ii. 23, V. iv. 4,
Phor. V. i. 14. See also Catull. CIII. 1, Cic. Epp. ad Att. VII. 3,
Hor. S. I. ix. 41, Epp. I. i. 62, vii. 15, XVI. 31, Ad Pisones 438.

It will be observed from the above examples that sodes usually
follows an imperative, but this is not the case invariably‚ as may be
