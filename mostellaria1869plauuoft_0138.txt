xciv PROLEGOMEN A.

V. ii. 34, Poen. ΙΙΙ. ii. 22, iii. 57, iv. 22, v. 26, V. vi. 26. The
following are in Anapaestic lines: Bac. V. ii. 64, Mil. IV. ii. 69 (72).
The line, Bac. ΙΙ. iii. 38, cannot be scanned as it appears in the
MSS. The reading of Rud. V. ii. 27 is very doubtful.

Ex. There are some passages quoted from Plautus in which
the syllable ex appears to be short in the words exemplum, engrere,
and exera'tus.

For exmplum we are referred to Rud. ΙΙ. iii. 40 (Iamb. Tetr. Cat.),

Iactamur exemplis plurimis miserae perpetuam noctem.

But metamur is an unskilful conjecture by Scheider; all the MSS.
have—
Iaclatae exemplis plurimis mzserae perpetuam noctem,

which presents no difficulty either in metre or construction, for
iactatae is here equivalent to iactatae sumus.
E'ngrere is quoted from Trin. IV. iii. 46 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Si mage exigere cupias duarum rerum exoritur oplc'o.

All the MSS. have sz' mage ,· A, F, have exagere,· B, C, D, E, have
cx genere ,· A has coapz'as-duarum,· all the rest of the MSS. cupias
duarum. Since the verb engrere and its tenses occur in at least
twenty passages in Plautus with the ex long, and this is a solitary
example on the other side, this is precisely one of those cases in
which a slight transposition may fairly be resorted to, and all difficulty
removed by reading—

Mage si exegere cupias duarum rerum exoritur optio.

There is yet another method of avoiding the supposition that ex
is shortened. llsagz‘s being one of those words which may be pro-
nounced as a monosyllable, mage may be altogether absorbed, as not
unfrequently takes place in sibi, tibi, scio, mea, eum, &c.

Exercere and its tenses, exercitus and its cases, occur nearly forty
times in Plautus, and in three of these exercitum and exercitu appear
to have the first short. It is to be remarked that the whole of these
examples are in the Amphitruo, and two of them within a few lines
of each other in the Prologue—a portion of the play which contains
a number of metrical licences within a short compass, and with
regard to the genuineness of which some good scholars have enter-
tained grave doubts. The passages are as follows:—

Exerct'lus. 1. Amph. Prol. 125 (Senar.)‚

Qui cum Amphz'lruone abiit lzt‘nc z'n exet-cilum,
