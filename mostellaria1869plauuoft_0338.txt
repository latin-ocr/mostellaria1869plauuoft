156 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

matrimonia] and mercantile transactions, we might naturally suppose
that inconciliare denoted ‘to separate,' ‘to set at variance,' ‘to disturb,’
a meaning which would suit the passage before us. But it has been
objected that this interpretation is contrary to analogy‚—that although
in has frequently a negative force when compounded with adjectives
or participles, it never has this force when compounded with verbs.
The old grammarians seem to have been in doubt as to the meaning
of inconciliare‚· thus Festus, or rather Paulus Diaconus, p. 107, ed.
Miill„“Inconciliastfi comparasti, commendasti, vel, ut antiqui, per dolum
decipere,’' where it is supposed that antiqui is intended to indicate
Plautus. The passages in which the word occurs are the following:
1. Bac. ΙΙΙ. vi. 21, Ille, quod in se suit, adcuralum habuit quod posset
mali Facere et in me inconciliare copias omnes meas. This is the reading
os the MSS. Camer. proposes fizcere cl, while R retains faceret and
reads zbzconcilzarem the former connects in me with inconciliare, the
latter with fizcerel. It must be observed that the change proposed
by R is more violent than that introduced by Camer., indeed the.
substitution ofsacerc et for facere! cannot be regarded as a change
at all—according to either reading, ‘to set at variance with me,’ ‘to
disturb or throw into confusion‚’ ‘to stir up against me,' would be
a satisfactory meaning. 2. The line in the Mostellaria, now before
us. 3. Trin. Ι. ii. 99, Inconciliaslin eum qui mandatus esl tibi, Ille qui
mandavit, eum exturbasti ex aedibus τ) Edepol mandalum pulcre el curatum
probe! Here the sense given by Paul. Diac.‚ ‘decipere pcr dolum‚' would
be more applicable. Goeller renders it, ‘malam rem ei et damnum
conciliare! Lastly‚ in the Persa, V. ii. 53, inconciliavil appears in the
printed editions, but the MSS. here are so corrupt that it is hard to
say whether the word inconciliavil is indicated at all, and therefore
we can found nothing upon this passage* On the whole, if we
admit that inconciliare cannot signify to ‘ disunite,' there is no reason
why it should not mean ‘to unite against,’ ‘to stir up opposition,'
and so ‘to bring trouble upon any one,’ which will suit the passage
from the Mostellaria, and hence, ultimately, ‘to injure' or ‘ deceive.'
87. Obici argenium &c.] If we adopt the reading given in our
text the meaning will be ‘Order, Ι beseech you, the mouth of this
unclean brute to bc plugged (gagged) with silver.' Os is here used
in its proper signification, but it is frequently employed by Plautus
to signify ‘the sace’ or ‘the whole hcad.’ Thus Capt. IV. ii. 11,
