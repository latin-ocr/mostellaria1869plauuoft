NOTES.

I. i. 1. Exi. . .soras.] Of the two forms of the word signifying a
door, sora of the first declension, and soris of the third, the former
is found only in the accusative plural foras, and the ablative plural
foris, and these are by some grammarians designated as adverbs.
We may say a few words upon each.

Forma—ist. In the great majority of cases in which foras is
employed it is combined with a verb which implies the movement of
the person or thing addressed or spoken of from the interior of a
house to the' door. The verbs generally used are, foras ire, abire,
exire, exsurgere, effugere, efferre, educere, seducere, deferre, excludere,
extrudere, excire, excitare, eicere, vocare, evocare, egredi, progredi,
pellere, edere se, proruere se*, prosequi, and the like. Less common
but still conveying the same idea, Trin. ΙΙ. ii. 1, Quo z'llz‘c lzomo
soros se penetravi! ex aedibus τ’ Eun. ΙΙ. iii. 66, Homo quatietur certe
cum dono foras, ‘hurled, kicked out.' Sometimes the expression is
figurative without reference to a door, as in Rud. Ι. ii. 82, fluctus eiecit
foras, ‘the wave has cast her forth ;' and Truc. I. i. 18, Pisces . . eduxit
foras, of drawing fish out of a pond in a net; and in Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 68
(64), abire foras is ‘to go to a foreign land ;’ and still stranger‚ Phor.V.
vii. 65, Vides peccatum tuum esse delatum foras, ‘carried out,’ i.e. ‘has
been hinted abroad‚ has been disclosed.' 2nd. The idea of motion
outwards‚ although always implied, is in one or two phrases much less
direct. Thus since vocari ad cenam foras means ‘to be invited out to
dinner‚’ so promittere foras ad cenam means ‘to accept such an invita-
tion,' ‘ to promise to go out to dinner.’ Thus Rud. V. iii. 64, Neve adeo
vocatos credam vos esse ad cenam foras ‚· and Most. IV. iii. 12 (iv. 12),
Promisz'soras Ad cenam, ne me te vocare censeas ,· and Stich. IV. ii. 16,

* In Eun. 111. v, 51, Foras simul omnes proruunt se is used with reference
to persons hurrying out of a room in the interior of a house in order to
procecd into another apartment.
