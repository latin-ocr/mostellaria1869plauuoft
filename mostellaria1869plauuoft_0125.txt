METRE AND PROSODY. lxxxv

Quo nemo adaeque iuventute ex omni Attica,

there is no correption, as indicated by Weise, but an Anapaest in
the 3rd place.
Oblivzscendz’ is a quadrisyllable in Mil. IV. viii. 49 (Troch. Tetr.

cah), Alulz'ebres mores discendi oblsvssscendi stratz'otz'ci,·

dz'vz'tz‘as a trisyllable in Rud. II. vi. 58 (Senar.)‚
Ibi me corruere posse aiebas dffitz‘as.
With regard to the line Merc. Prol. 29,
Inhaeret etiam aviditas, desidia, intarta,

which is sometimes referred to as an example of v dropped, it is
scarcely possible to scan it as it stands, and Parcus is probably
right when he proposes to omit elsam altogether.

The example of ᾱῦο contracted, quoted from Aul. Prol. 5, depends

upon an unnecessary change in the reading of the best MSS. In
Amph. IV. iii. 16 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Seu patrem sive avom videbo ΙΙ optruncabo in aedibus,

we may either consider ᾱῡοηι as a monosyllable, or §zz-re as a mono-
syllable and totally elided. A good example of avos as a monosyllable
occurs in Men. Prol. 44 (Senar.)‚

Et zpsus eodem esl αῖοῖ· vocatus nomine.

3. But this shortening or contractiori takes place in the middle
of many words without the presence of the letter v. Thus aspero,
circulos, manipulus, gubernaculo, oracula, saecula, pericula, vincula,
laminae, and many others become aspro, circlos, maniplos, gubernaclo,
oracla, saecla, pericla, vincla, lamnae. This takes place most sre-
quently when a short vowel in the middle of a word is separated
from another vowel by a liquid, as in the above examples; but this
is by no means a necessary condition, for we find caldior for calidior,
puertia for puerilia, unzversum for universum, calfacit for calefacit,
and Quintilian Ι. 6, tells us that in his time calfacit was more
common than calefacit.

4. Other contractz'ons. When e is followed by another vowel in
the same word, it frequently coalesces with it in dactylic verse,
generally, though not uniformly, from necessity. Thus we have aurffi,
alvffzrz'a, eadem, ea—edem, respondeamus, αενῖι, arone-z, ferrei, alvffi,
aureo, e—odem, e’oTsdem.

So also oo is contracted in such words as effluerz‘nt, cooperiant.
