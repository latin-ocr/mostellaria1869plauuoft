ORTHOGRAPHY. xxxiii

But we may go farther, and lay it down as a general mle, that down
to B.C. 100, or even later, the combination vv (uu) was unknown,
whether the first v had the force of a vowel or of a consonant.
Thus not only did the ancients write volnus, volgus, cervos, servos,
but also mortuos, compascuos, aequom, quom, and the like invariably, and
Ι know not why Ritschl and others should have made an exception
and written tuus and suus instead of tuos, suos* Thus MORTVOS
[6], AIQVOM [10]‚ EQVOM, MORTVOS, PERPETVOM,
SVOS ter [12]‚ COMFLVONT, FLOVIOM, FLOVIVM septies,
FLOVIO quater, FLOVI, 1N1QVOM, IOVENTIO, RIVOM
[13], AEQVOM [15, 17, 18]. So with quom, quez'quomqua &c.:
QVOM [5, 10 bis, 12 quinquies, 14, 15 bis, 19 quater], QVEI-
QVOMQVE [11, 12 sexies, 14 octies, 16, 17, 19 sexies, 20 sexies]‚
QVOIA [12‚ 18 bz‘s], QVOIVM [12 bis, 14 bz's], QVOIVS [1, 12],
QVOIVSQVE [12‚ 14, 20 quater]‚ QVOI [12]‚ QVOIQVE [20 bz's]‚
QVOIEI [5, 12, 14]‚ QVOIEIQVE [14 quinquies}

Ofor E.

There are two words which, during the period of the Republic,
so far as our evidence extends, were invariably written with 0,
although e afterwards prevailed. These are Voster, and Vort0† with
its derivatives and compounds: thus VOSTRAE, VOSTRVM,
VOSTRA [15], ARVORSVM [10]‚ VORSVS, ADVORSVS,
ADVORSVM [11]‚ AVORSVM bis, ADVORSVS, ADVOR-
SARIVM, ARVORSARIO ler [12]‚ CONTROVORSIEIS,
CONTROVORSIAS‚ CONTROVOSIAS, SVRSVMVORSVM,
SVRSVORSVM, SVSO VORSVM [13], ADVORTIT [15],
ADVORSVS [18 bis].

There was a tradition in the time of Quintilian that the change
from 0 to e in vertices, versus, and such like words, was first intro-
duced by Scipio Africanus: “ Quid dicam vortices et vorsus, ceteraque
ad eundem modum, quae primo Scipio Africanus in E literam
secundam vertisse dicitur?'’ But if we can put saith in the gram-
marians, many words in addition to the above were written with 0,

* [Here too, as in some other cases, 1 have thought it best to retain
in the text the spelling sanctioned by Ritschl, Fleckeisen, and the Plautine
critics, and have written uniformly tuus, suus, tuum, suum, &c.‚ notwith-
standing the opinion here expressed.—-En.]

† VERSVS occurs in n. 603, an inscription which professes to belong
to B.C. 58, but which is attended with so many suspicions circumstances
that it cannot be regarded as possessing any authority.
