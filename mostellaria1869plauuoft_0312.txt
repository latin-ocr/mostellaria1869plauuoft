1 30 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Medic. fac. 73, Nec cerussa tibi, nec nitri spuma rubentis Desit, et
Illyrica quae venit iris Ιιιιηιο, but here it forms part of a complieated
recipe. We find the word cerussatus quoted from Cic. in Pison. XI.
(cerussataeque buccae, when describing the general appearance of
Gabinius), but all the MSS. here are corrupt, and present pulsatae,-
it occurs, however, in Martial VII. xxv. 2, Dulcia cum tantum scribas
epigrammata semper Et cerussata candidiora cute. There is another
Ep. of Mart. in which cerussa is mentioned, X. xxii„ Cur spleniato
saepe prodeam mento Albave pictus sana labra cerussa, Philaeni, quaeris Β
basiare te nolo.

102. Atramentum] when used to denote a black pigment, is what
we call lamp-black, and the mode in which it was usually prepared
is distinctly described in Plin. H. N. XXXV. 6, ξ 2 5, Fit enim e fuligine
pluribus modis, resina vel pice exustis, propter quod etiam officinas aedifi-
cavere sumum eum non emittentes. Cf. Vitruv. VII. 10. Apelles and
Micon are said to have used atramentum made from the charcoal of
grape-stones‚ while Apelles also employed bone-black obtained from
ivory. (Plin. l.c.) Atramentum librarium, or writing-ink, was composed
by mixing atramentum with gum, while in atramentum tectorium, for
stuccoing the walls of rooms‚ glue was the vehicle. (V itruv. Le.)
Totally distinct from the atramentum described above was what the
Romans called atramentum sutorium, and the Greeks χάλκανθον. This,
as is evident from the description of Pliny (H. N. XXXIV. § 32), was
sulphate of iron, which, when applied to tanned leather, would stain
it black, forming exactly the compound which constitutes the common
writing ink of modern times*

- postules] i. e. ‘you may as well try (expect) at the same time
to whiten ivory with lamp-black.' It is commonly set down in
books upon Latin Synonyms that postulo is the strongest of all the
verbs which signify ‘to seek’ or ‘to ask for,' and that it denotes that
the person employing it peremptorily demands something to which
he has an unquestionable right. This is however by no means the
common force of the word when used colloquially. We shall find
a great number of passages in the dramatists where it means simply
⁴ to desire‚’ ‘to want,' or ‘to try to do something,' and ‘to expect to
be able to do;' in addition it sometimes conveys the idea that a

* When Cic. Epp. Fam. lx. 21, speaking of Cn. Carbo the partizan
of Marius sayS‚ Iam pater eius, accusatus a M. Antonio, sutorio atramento
absolutus putatur, he probably means that he poisoned himself with this
substance, but the explanation is uncertain. Galen reckons it among
poisons. Consult Pereira.
