and Most. III. i. 55,
D. Iam hercle ego illunc nominabo. ΙΙ T. Euge! strenue,-

6. All exclamations, z'nlery'ectzons, impre'cahons, and the like, are

exempted from elision, as they are indeed from all the ordinary
rules of prosody. Aul. II. viii, 22,

Perii hercle! ΙΙ aurum rapitur! aula quaeritur.
Mil. IV. viii. 20,
O mei oculi! 0 mi anime! P. Opsecro, lene mulierem.

7. We have already pointed out that Iambic‚ Trochaic, and Cretic
Tetrameters must be regarded as Asynartete verses, and therefore it

is unnecessary to notice the hiatus which occurs again and again at
the end of the 4th foot in these measures.

We must repeat, however, that we would not confine the neglect
os elision to the particular cases specified above. We would merely
point out that it occurs frequently under these circumstances, and
when encountered need excite no suspicion with regard to the
genuineness of the text.

Rule os Posz'lz'on.

But after these obstacles have been cleared away, the chief
difficulty remains untouched. As soon as scholars began to turn
their attention to the metres of Plautus and Terence, they found
a great number of lines which apparently could not be scanned at
all without violating the Rule of Position, which may be said to lie
at the very foundation of Latin prosody. We shall quote several
os these lines, selecting as examples those which belong to the
kinds of verse whose structure is well ascertained, and in which
there is no evident corruption of the text.

Bentley, in his celebrated Schedmsma de Maris T erenlz'am's, admits

the facts as in many cases indisputable and points out that his
