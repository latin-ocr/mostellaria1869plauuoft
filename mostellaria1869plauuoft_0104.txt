lxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Either of the long syllables os the Cretic may be resolved, and in
this way the fourth Paeon (υ υ o —) and the first Paeon (- υ υ υ)
become admissible, thus—

Fourth Paeon in 2nd‚

AlIusz'ce hercle ‹Tgffis ablatem ila ut vos decer.

Fourth Paeon in 3rd,

Nos prcfi’clo probe ul vblmmzis vzlrz'mus.

Fourth Paeon in rst and first Paeon in 3rd,

Dominffcs {ndilzgens reddere <was nevolt.

But, in addition to these feet, the Romans (not the Greeks) admit
the Molossus. This doctrine was first distinctly laid down by Bentley,
in his notes on Cic. Tusc. 111. 19, and Terent. Adel. IV. iv. 2.*

Examples are common—

In 1st and 2nd,

Vino bt viar} piscatu probo electili.
In 1st and 3rd,
processerunt ila ul dicis fhcla haud nego,

In rst. 2nd‚ and 3rd,

Venis navzs nostr-(ie mlvi qude frangat ratem,
where navis is to be pronounced as a monosyllable.

Generally speaking, the Cretic vindicates to itself the 4th place,
but even into this the Molossus and the fourth Paeon occasionally
intrude, but not the first Paeon.

According to what has been said the scheme of the Cretic
Tetrameter Acat. will be—

—w-‘—u— -υ- -υ-

υυυ-ἶυυυ- υυυ-Ι
- mmm—
-υυυ -υυυ -υυυ( --)

There is another point connected with the scansion of Cretic
Tetrameters which deserves special attention, viz.‚ that the two halves
are Asynartete, and thus the last syllable of the second foot may

¹⁸² lt is admitted, somewhat grudgingly, by Hermann, with a qualification
not very precise nor easily applied—“ qui pes tamen ita temperari solet, ut
aut propter ambiguitatem mensurae non sit molossus, ut in Plauti Captivis
11. i. 1 1 ; aut solutos sinat, quos argento emerit, vel ubi concede huc, secede
huc, et similia retracto in primam syllabam accentu dicuntur3 aut a pro-
nuntiatione accentum solum sequente obscuretur, ut in Rudente 1. v. 15, 19,

Quaene eiectae e mari ambae sumus, te opsecro
Vt tuo recipias tecto, servesque nos.'’
