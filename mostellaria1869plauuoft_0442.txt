Sometimes he is to be tied round with rods. as a noscgay of
myrtles is bound with rushes: Rud. III. iv. 26, Vos adeo, ubi ego
innuero vobis, si ne ei capul exoculassitae's Quasi murlela mucis, item
ego vos virgis czrcumvinciam.

Sometimes he is to be required to quaff a draught expressed from
the fructus fullonius, i. e. the staves with which eloth-scourers beat
and thumped the woollen garments consigned to them: Pseud. III.
i. 15, Nunc nisi lenoni munus hodie misem, Cras milli potandus fructus
esl fullonius.

Sometimes an entertainment is provided, scot-free, for his shoul-
ders: Epid. Lnii. 22, Sine meo sumptu paratae iam sunl scapulis
sumbolae.

Sometimes a well-flayed back is compared to a richly-embroidered
carpet: Pseud. Ι. ii. 12, Ila ego vostra latera loris faciam ut valide
varia sint, Vt ne perz'slromala quidem aeque picta sint Campanica, IVeque
Alexandrina belluala conchuliala tapetia.

We talk in familiar English of ‘giving a fellow a good dressing3'
exactly the same idea is expressed in Heaut. V. i. 77, C. Sed Surum—

pexum, ul dum vival, meminerit semper mei.

When it was wished to make the punishment more severe, the
culprit was manacled and drawn up to a beam, from which he was

gling z* Phor. I. iv. 43, Ego plectar pendens nisi quid me fisellerit,·
Eun. V. ἡ. 20, Tu iam pendebzs qui stallum adulesccnlulum nobilitas
Flagilizs; Poen. Ι. i. 18, Suspende, vinci, verbera, auctor sum, εἶπα,-
Most. V. ii. 45 (iii. 45), Verberibus, lutum, caedere pendens: As. 111.

We find occasionally the expression pendere per pedes, which,

loan.’ The MSS. of Terence vary between versuram and versura: which-
ever we adopt the general meaning will be the same. Cf. Cic. ad Att.
V. 15, V. 21, Pro Fonteio 1., Tacit. Ann. VI. 16, Paul. Diae. 5.ν. Ver-

when a man resorts to bon-owing.

* Hence the proverbial phrase pendentem ferire, which means to strike
a person who is incapable of making any resistance. This is used in
Trin. 11. i. ¹9 of a lady who has completely enthralled her lover, and
makes all manner of demands on him, Ibi illa pendentem fi’rit.
