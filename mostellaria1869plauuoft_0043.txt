ORTHOGRAPHY. xvii

by very satisfactory evidence that certain modes of spelling, not only
particular words, but whole classes of words, were not introduced
until long after the death of Plautus, and therefore could not possibly
have been employed by him. Everything leads to the conclusion
that a gradual change took place in orthography from the time of
Ennius down to the first century of the Empire ; that for a consider-
able period a struggle took place between some of the old and
of the new forms, and hence we find them frequently side by side3
that several of the former were quickly superseded, while not a few
of the latter were not admitted at all until a comparatively late period.
It is to those old forms—which kept their ground steadily‚ and were
still in general use when Cicero, Pompeius, and Caesar were born,
when not a little of the roughness of the olden time still lingered—
that we desire chiefly to direct attention. They are not very
numerous; they are easily learned; and they will serve to give an
antique flavour at least to the language of one of Rome's earlier
writers.

It was probably something of this sort that Ritschl intended to
effect when he says, “id agamus ut, qualem aliquanto politior aetas
Plautum legisse videatur, quoad eius fieri possit, recuperemus.'’ But
in carrying out this intention it appears to me that he very frequently
neglects the best testimony and puts saith in the worst—that he is
inconsistent, arbitrary‚ fanciful, and not seldom positively wrong, so
that we can in no way accept his conclusions as authoritative.

Before going farther‚ it will be necessary to state and examine the
sources from which our information upon questions of orthography
is derived. These are three in number—I. The Grammarians;
11. Manuscripts; ΙΙΙ. Inscriptions.

Ι. The Grammarians.

Any one who should attempt to ascertain the ancient orthography
of the Latin language, or even the orthography of any particular
period, by relying on the statements of the ancient grammarians,
would speedily find himself involved in inextricable confusion. He
will discover that they frequently contradict not only each other, but
also themselves: they frequently declare, in treating of such matters,
that a word ought to be spelled in a certain manner, in accordance
with their own theories‚ without referring to the actual usage of any
particular period, and not seldom present their own theories‚ fancies

and conjectures as if they were reacl1 facts. Moreover‚ the text of these
