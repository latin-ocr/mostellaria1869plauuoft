expolitum ut inprobare non queas? and again, III. iii. 64, si hodie hunc
dolum dolamus, where we remark the play on dolum and dolamus.

26. Sometimes he is an anvil on which a deceiver is, like a smith‚
to hammer out his tricks: thus Pseud. 11. ii. 20, Pseudolus says of
Harpax, lVam haec mihi incus est: procudam ego hodie ln'nc multos
dolos.

27. Versare. Sometimes he is a piece of meat or a lentil in a
frying-pan, which is tossed and turned over by the cook until ‘ done
brown :’ Bac. IV. v. 6, Vorsabo* ego illum hodie, si vivo, probe, Tam
frictum ego illum reddam quam frz'clum est cicer, ‘ until he is done
brown;’ Pers. V. ii. 17, Quid ais, crux, slt'mulorum lrt'lors‘ quomodo me
hodie vorsazv'stz'! Vt mein tricas coniecisti! quomodo de Persa manus
miln' adila est.

28. Extexere. Sometimes he is a piece of old eloth or rope
which is pulled down or unravelled for the sake of the thread: Bac.
II. iii. 5, Extexam ego illum pulcre zum, sz' Di volunt, where exlexo
iS a ἅπ. λεγ.

29. This is the proper place to notice a set of words which are
frequently, although by no means uniformly, employed by the
dramatists to denote ‘fraud,’ ‘deceit,' and ‘imposture.' They are
Ludus, Ludi, Ludibrium, Ludo, Ludg‘facio, Ludzfico, Deludo, Inludo,
and some ,other compounds of Ludo.

i. Ludus. In so far as the substantive ludus is concerned we
must carefully distinguish the singular ludus from the plural ludi.
Ludus, in the singular, signifies in Plautus and Terence, as in other
authors, ‘play‚' ‘sport‚’ ‘fun‚' ‘amusement,’ and also ‘a place of
instruction,⁷ ‘a school.’ Thus, in the sense of ‘play‚' ‘sport,’ &c.;
Rud. II. iv. 13, Olz'um ubi eril, lum libi operam ludo el deliciae dabo,-
Capt. IV. i. 2, Maxumas opt'mz'lales opzparasque obfers milei, Laudem,
lucrum, ludum, iocum, festivitatem, stre'as,· As. Prol. 13, Inest lepos
ludusque in hac Comoedz'a,· so Bac. Ι. ii. 8, Pseud. I. i. 63, Iocus, ludus,
sermo,· Truc. Ι. ii. 11, per loculum et ludum. In Pseud. V. i. 32 the
drunken slave, aster telling that he had had a tumble, adds, z'a’suz'l
naenia ludo, which means, ‘that (tumble) brought my fun to a
melancholy end,' ‘turned my merriment into wailing.' Ludus in the
sense of ‘a school’ occurs in Rud. Prol. 43, Eam vidit ire e ludo
fidz'cz'no domum‚· and Pers. ΙΙ. i. 6, Nam equidem le iam sector quintum

’³‘ On the other hand Versutus signifies one who is ‘versatile‚’ who can
turn his wits to any-thing, and therefore ‘subtle‚’ ‘craftyz’ As. l. i. 105,
Non esse servos peior hoc quisquam potest, Nec magis vorsutus, nec ab quo
caveas magis: Epid. 111. ii. 35, Vorsutior es quam rota figularis.
