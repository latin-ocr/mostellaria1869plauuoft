ORTHOGRAPHY. xxi

But when Cornutus, in the passage quoted above, enjoins us to
write causa, and adds, “ nec quemquam moveat antiqua scriptura
nam et accussare per duo SS scripserunt‚” and when Mar. Vict.
asserts that the antiqui wrote such words as ausus, causa, fusus,
odzbsus, with a double S, aussus, &c.‚ we infer from the passage in
Quintilian, quoted above, that antiqua scriptura and antiqui indicate
not the predecessors of Ennius, but the cotemporaries of Cicero and
Virgil.

The passage from Mar. Vict. on the same topic is such a curious
mass of confusion and contradiction, that we have quoted it at length
above, to avoid the suspicion of misrepresenting his meaning. From
this it will be seen that he enunciates three propositions: (1) that the
antiqui did not double consonants at all; (2) that when it was neees-
sary (oportebat) to double a consonant, they placed a mark called
a Sicilicus over the consonant to be doubled; (3) that the antiqui
did double the consonants in words quae pressiore sono eduntur, such
as ausas, causa, ἀς. Nisus says the same thing with regard to the
Sicilicus, but is very properly censured by Velius Longus, who remarks
that there is in reality no difference between doubling a consonant
and placing a mark over a single consonant, to point out that it was
to be pronounced as double. But the curious circumstance con-
nected with these statements is, that among all the inscriptions
preserved, no trace of any mark corresponding to what is called the
Sicilicus can be discovered.

Moreover, the ancient grammarians frequently state their own fancies
and conjectures and theories as if they were acknowledged facts.
Thus Cornutus, in the passage already quoted, partially leads us to
infer that the use of the double S in such words assuisse, divim-se,
esse, and causasse, was an antiqua scriptura as much as accussare,
whereas in point of fact these words were uniformly written with a
double S, except in the very earliest times. With equal recklessness
Velius Longus, l.c., asserts that the verb narro ought to be spelled
with a single R, because it is derived from gnarus!
