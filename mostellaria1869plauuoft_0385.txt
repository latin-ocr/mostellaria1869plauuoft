ExcvRsvs iit-[Mo. 1 99

said ‘zufilz'czler',·’ Adel. V. viii. 2, D, Ego vero iubeo, el in hac re, ‘el
aliis omnibus Quam maxume unam facere nos hanc familiam, Colere,
adiuvare, adiungere. A. Ila quaeSO, paler. M'. Iiaud aliter censeo.
D. Imo hercle ila nobis decet: here imo indicates an exception taken
to the word censeo as too feeble: M. ‘My sentiments are the same.
D. ‘Nay‚ (‘censeo' is not the word, this is not a matter of opinion or
sentiment,) it is our duty ;' Eun. V. ii. 33, C. At nunc dehinc spero
aeternam inter nos gratiam Fore, leais .· saepe ex huiusmodi re quapiam
et Malo principio magna familiaritas Conflata esl : quid si hoc quis-
piam voluit Deus? T. Equidem pol in eam pat-lem accipioque el volo.
C. Imo ila quaeso: here imo refers to the words accipio et volo as
contrasted with the more earnest quaeso. We may thus paraphrase
the passage: T. ‘Assuredly Ι am ready to view the matter under this
aspect (i. e. as intended by the Gods to establish ‘aelerna gratia'
between us) and Ι am willing that such may be the result.' C. ‘Nay‚
(‘ready and willing’ are not the words) Ι implore the Gods that this
may came to pass.’

When imo is employed to correct and strengthen‚ it may frequently
be translated by ‘nay‚ more ;' Adel. ΙΙΙ. iv. 36, H. Ilzmc abduce,
vinci, quaere rem. G. *Imo hercle extorque, ‘nay, more (take stronger
measures still), wrench the truth out of him by torture ;' Eun. ΙΙΙ. ν.
14, A. lVarra isluc, quaeso, quid sict. C. Imo ego le opsecro hercle ul
audias, ‘nay‚ more, (not only will Ι tell you as you request, but) Ι
implore you to listen;’ Phor. V. viii. 58, N. Salis libi est? P. Jmo
vero pulcre discedo el probe Et praeter spem .· here imo refers to salis .-
‘nay‚ more than that (not only am I content, but) I come off glo-
riously and beyond my expectations 3' Heaut. IV. viii. 1 1, M. Erravit
res acta .· quanla de spe decidi! C. Imo, lzaec quidem, quae apud me
est, Clz'lophonz's est Amica, ‘nay (that is not all), more than that;' so
in Phor. V. viii. 54, imo means ‘nay‚ more, Ι have not done yet;’
Aul. IV. X. 51, L. Filiam ex le lu habes. E. lmo, eccillam domi ,-
here, at first sight, we might suppose that imo was equivalent to
simple ‘yes,’ but the true force is ‘nay‚ more than that, not only
have I a daughter, but she is there in my house even now ;’ Hec. V.
iv. 29, Pamphilus (v. 26> enjoins silence upon Bacchis (neque opus est
adeo mulino), who replies‚ [mo eliam lzoc qui occultari facilius credas,
dabo, ‘nay‚ more, (not only will Ι keep the secret) but I will supply
you with inf01·mation‚' &c. See other examples of imo eliam in
Andr. IV. i. 31, 50, ii. 25, Phor. V. vi. 37, in all of which ‘nay more'
is the proper translation.

This force of imo is well developed in the Bacchides II. ii. 27.
