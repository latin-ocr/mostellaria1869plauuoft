dialogue is carried on either in the Iambic Trimeter Acat. or in
Trochaic Tetrameter Cat.; that the Iambic Tetrameter Cat., the
measure of which Aristophanes was so fond, is occasionally
employed, and also, although more sparingly, Trochaic and Iambic
Tetrameters Acatalectic. Moreover, Bacchiae and Cretic Tetra-
meters are so frequently introduced that they can be easily recog-
nised‚ and also, although with less certainty, the shorter species
and varieties of verses belonging to the whole of the four classes
specified.

But, in so far as the Cantica are concerned, the case is altogether
different. Some of these present little or no difficulty, in others all
is doubt, uncertainty, and confusion. Metrical scholars have accord-
ingly here given free rein to their imaginations‚ and, as might have
been anticipated, have arrived at the most discordant results. We
have excellent examples of both kinds of Cantica in the Mostellaria.
The Canticum with which the Second Act commences can be
arranged in a satisfactory manner with little difficulty, and without
any important changes in the text, and we shall take an opportunity
below of reviewing it in detail. But the Canticum with which the
Fourth Act commences presents a different aspect. In B, the most
trustworthy of our MSS„ the monologue is divided into twenty-five
lines, of which four in succession (6, 7, 8, 9) are mutilated, ex-
hibiting lacunae to the extent of about two words in each, and v. 15
is evidently very corrupt. Hermann (Lib. II. c. xxiii.) distributes
the words into twenty-six lines, leaves many blanks‚ and introduces
several conjectural changes. Ritschl distributes the words into
twenty-seven lines, introducing a set of changes different from those
of Hermann, and agreeing with him as to the structure of seven or
eight lines only. Weise distributes the words into thirty-seven lines,
(liffering totally from those of Hermann and Ritschl. The remainderv
of the scene, in which a second speaker is introduced, is distributed
in B into seventeen lines, and by Hermann into the same number,
but his arrangement is totally different. Some critics had sup-,
posed that they were irregular Cretics, but Hermann has convinced
himself that they may be divided into Iambic Tetrameters Cat., but
admits that numerous alterations are necessary.* Ritschl adopts
this theory and most of Hermann's emendations in so sar as the
first eleven lines are concerned, but the remainder he supposes to
consist of a compound measure, made up os an Iambic Dimeter.
