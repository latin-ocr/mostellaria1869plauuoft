content to remain a slave sor ever, provided only that 1 could meet
with Libanus just now!

4. Vt, ‘that,' is used very elliptically in the following passage,
where a threat is conveyed: Pers. V. ii. 9, Quem pol ego ut non in
crucz'alum atque in compedes cogam εἰ vivam, ‘ nor shall anything pre-
vent me from consigning this fellow to chains and torture‚’ where ut
non cogam is equivalent to nec possum prohiberi quin cogam.

There is yet another elliptical use of ul, which may however be
ranked under (2): Poen. IV. ii. 90, Valeas, beneque ut tibi sil, where
we might supply precor, but the ellipse seems to be cura, which
appears in the next line, in the reply of Sincerastus‚ Vale, et haec cura
clanculum ul sint dz'cta,· so again, Stich. I. ii. 48, De'sctpulus venio ad
magistras: quibus matronas moribus, Quae optumae sunt, esse oportet:³
sed utraque ut dicat mihi, where it is more natural to supply cura
than precor, ‘see that each of you two answer me!

In a few cases it is open to us to translate ul either by ‘how' or
by ‘in order that :' thus Cist. Ι. i. 95, G. Mem istum hominem vellem
dari, Vt ego illum zvorsarem ! which we may render, according to the
punctuation we select, either ‘in order that I might turn him over
and over‚' or, putting a comma after dari and a note of admiration
after vorsarem, ‘ how Ι would turn him over and over 1’ the idea being
perhaps taken from a cook grilling meat, or tossing an omelette in
a frying pan. The English phrase of ‘turning a person round one’s
finger' implies the same amount of absolute control on one side, and
helplessness on the other.

In Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 40 we may translate ut either by ‘as’ or ‘how:'
P. Quid erat zudula p an regillam induculam, an mendt'culam Implu-
vt'alam ,Ρ ul islae fizcz'unt veslz‘menlz's nomina, where ut may be either
‘as they call their dresses‚' or, making it an exclamation, ‘how they
call,’ i. e. ⁴ what strange names, to be sure, they give their dresses !’

In the following passages, which are all difficust, ul, if the true
reading, must be equivalent to ulul: Poen. IV. ii. 9, Quodvis genus
ibi hominum videas, quasi Acherontem veneris, Equitem, peditem, liber-
tinum, fierem ac fugitivom vele's, Verberatunss vinclum, addictum, qui
habet quod del, ul homo est, i.e. ‘he who has money to spend‚ whatever
kind of man he is,' where Bothe and others adopt utut, the conj. of
Gulielm.; Merc. Prol. 81, Amens, antam-que, ul animum obfirmo meum,
Dico esse iturum me mercatum, si velit, where ul must signify ‘ as best
I may‚’ or ‘ when I steel my resolution, Ι then say to my father‚' &c.:
Pylades here reads utut, Ritschl conj. astutum,- Phor. V. iv. 1, Laetus
sum, ut meae res sese habent, fralri optzgrzkse quod volt: the best MSS.
