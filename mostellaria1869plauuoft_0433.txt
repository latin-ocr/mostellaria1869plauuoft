EXCVRSVS xlv—TALENTVM, MJNA, ἅτ. 245

were known as Gold Philips, they were up to a recent period to be
found in circulation on the eastern borders of Europe, they are still
frequently discovered in large hoards, and numerous specimens are
to be seen in all collections of ancient Greek medals.* They are
mentioned frequently in Plautus‚† and must have been a common
medium when the authors of the New Comedy flourished.

We may enumerate the different names by which they are designated.

In the Poenulus we find three hundred spoken of as, Ι. i. 37, auree·
trecenti numi th'lt'ppez’; III. iv. 3, aurei trecenti numi qui vocantur
th'lzppei,· iii. 57, trecentos numos th'lzppow I. iii. 6, trecentos Plu·-
lzppos. In the Bacchides we find two hundred spoken os, IV. viii.
41, ducentos numos aureos th‘lzppos probos ,· ii. 7, ducentos Philippos
aureos,· cf. ix. 45, 87, 103, ducenlos numos Philippos,- viii. 27, ducents
Phe'lz'ppz',· cf. v. 38, ix. 127, and simply v. 10, ducenti numz',· cf. IV.
iv. 55, 58, viii. 32. In the Trinumus, a thousand, V. ii. 34, mille
auri th'lz'ppu7n,· v. 15, mille numum aurcum; cf. IV. ii. 112, where
the reading is doubtfu13 see also As. I. iii. 1, Trin. I. ii. 115.

When Agorastocles says, Poen. I. ii. 132, Sunt mihi inlus nescio
quot numi aurei lumplzalz'cz', he means ‘ gold Philips struggling to make
their escape,’ as if they were madmen under restraint.

There is a puzzling passage in Rud. V. ii. 26: Labrax is describing
the contents of the Vidulus; we read in the Vulgate Text, qumz'
oclz'ngenlz' aurci in nmrsupz'o sns‘heruttl, Praeterea (mlum denaria Plu·-
lae‘ppea z'n pasceolo seorsus, but the word ‹frnarz'a is altogether destitute
of support from any good MS. The Vetus Codex of Camerarius
gives, preterea centum mna plze'lzppz'a, which may mean ‘a hundred
Minae in Philips‚’ if we suppose that there was a familiar idiom by
which the singular could be substituted for the plural, as when we
talk of ‘ a hundred pound.'

It would appear that Philips, in consequence of the ease with
which they could be procured, and the purity of the metal, were
commonly employed as bullion by artificers who executed works in
gold3 hence the allusion in Cure. ΙΙΙ. 70, z'bz' nunc slaluam roll dare
auream Solidamfizcz'undam ex auro Philippeo.

* They passed into Gaul and from thence to Britain, and the whole of
the early gold coinage of these countries “may be said to consist of imi-
tations more or less rude and degenerate of the Macedonian Philippus.”
See the admirable work of Mr. John Evans on the Coins of the Ancient
Britons. Lond. 1864, p. 24.

† Never in Terence, who adhered more closely than Plautus to his
Greek originals. The name of Philip may not have been agreeable to an
Athenian audience.
