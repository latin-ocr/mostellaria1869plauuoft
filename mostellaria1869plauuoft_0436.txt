248 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Although A'umus must mean a Dz'drachm in the passage quoted
above from the Truculentus, there are two others in which com-
mentators have believed that it clearly denotes a different sum, and
these we must examine.

In Heaut. III. iii. 38 Syrus fabricates a story to the following
effect: that an old woman of Corinth had borrowed 1000 drachmae
(drachmarum argenti mille) from Bacchis, and, having died without
paying her debt, that her young daughter Antiphila had been left as
security in the hands of Bacchis, Ea relicta huic arraboni pro illo
argento, Everything is distinct up to v. 43, but unfortunately the
text of the two lines which follow (44, 45). as they appear in the
older editions, is admitted by all to be corrupt, and has been variously
emended by different editors. In these lines the words mille numum
are found, and the sense is taken to be that Bacchis now wishes
Clinias to pay her 1000 numi, in consideration of which she will give
up Antiphila. It is taken for granted that the mille numum are
identical with the drachunmrum argenti mille previously mentioned,
and hence it is inferred that numus is here used as equivalent to
drachma. Now although it might be fairly urged that a passage in
which the text is avowedly corrupt and the meaning uncertain cannot
be received in evidence at all. yet, even admitting the interpretation
to be generally correct, it by no means follows that the conclusion
is inevitable. Syrus, to answer his own ends, had just characterised
Bacchis as a pessuma meren-Ar, and what is more likely than that he
should represent such a person as not satisfied with having the mere
principal of the sum which she had lent repaid, but as secking a large
addition for interest, and as taking advantage of the passion of Clinias
to demand double the original loan, that is, according to the view
given above, 1000 ,Numi or 2000 Drachmae. Terence uses numus
in one other passage only, Phor. I. i. 3, 4, where the phrase intro-
duced, pauxilulum numerum, decides nothing.

The second passage is in Most. ΙΙ. i. 10, Vel isli qui [hastis] trium
numerum causa subeunt sub falas, where Lipsius and others interpret
lres numito mean lres asses, and to refer to the daily pay of a Roman
soldier. It is urged that this explanation is corroborated by the
well-known passage in Polybius (VI. 37), where he informs us that
the Roman legionary received two obols a day, which, if we adopt the
common practice of the Greek and Roman writers, and reckon the
drachma and the denarius as equivalent‚ would amount to 3²} asses. But
there are various considerations which render this opinion untenable.
