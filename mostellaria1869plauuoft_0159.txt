METRE AND PROSODY. cxiii

Rudens has the first syllable short in Virgil—

Exoritur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum ,·

but in the following line of Plautus the first syllable must be long,
Rud. IV. iii. 76 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Mitte rudentem, sceleste J—Mzuam, omitte vidulum.

The word occurs again v. 1 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.), and v, 92 (Troch.
Tetr. Cat.), but these passages do not decide the quantity of the
first syllable.

Nebula, which has the first short in the Augustan writers, is said
to have the first sometimes long and sometimes short in Plautus.
It occurs four times: in Pseud. Ι. v. 48 (Senar.), where, according
to the received reading, it has the first short; in Poen. Ι. ii. 62
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.), where the reading is very doubtful, but that
adopted by the best editors admits of nebulae having the first short;
in Cas. IV. iv. 21, where the distribution of the lines is entirely
arbitrary and uncertain3 and lastly, in Capt. V. iv. 26,

Nunc edepol demum in memoriam regredior, quom cogito
Quasi per nebulam, Hegionem patrem meum vocarier,

where the speech of Tyndarus is slow and hesitating‚ as he strives
to recall the impressions of his childhood. An actor therefore would
probably make a considerable pause after Quasi per nebulam, which
is itself a sort of parenthetic clause, and as even the most fastidious

could scarcely insist upon the elision of the last syllable in nebulam,
it may therefore be regarded as a Tribrach.

Neutiquam. Neuter. Lindemann says that neutiquam is always a
Tribrach, and neuter a pyrrich, by which he means, Ι presume, that
neutiquam is always a quadrisyllable with the first three short, and
neuter a trisyllable with the first two short. The examples which I
find of these words are, Capt. ΙΙΙ. ἰν. 54 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Filium tuum quod redimere se ait, id neutiquam mihi placet,

where neutiquam, according to my scansion, is neutquam,· Mil. III.
i. 37 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Si albicapillus hic videtur neutiquam ab ingeniosi senex.

Here also neutiquam ab form a Trochee. B. has albus capillus,

C. albi capillus, but this makes no difference. Merc. 111. ἰν. 14
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Nunc quid restat, hei, dzsperii, voltus neutiquam lzuius placet.

Here, if we consider huius as a monosyllable, we might scan neutiquam,
