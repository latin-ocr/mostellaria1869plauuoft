62. quin lotae Perpetuae ruant] ‘tumble down, with a crash, from
top to bottom‚¹ the fall being uninterrupted, no portion being left
standing. Perpetuus properly conveys the idea of unbroken con-
tinuity 3 it is seldom, if ever, equivalent to the English perpetual, in the
sense of ‘ lasting for ever‚' but the meaning may generally be expressed
by ‘uninterrupted’ Thus perpetua iuga, applied by Pliny (H. N. III.
v. 7) to the course of the Apennines from the Alps to the extremity
of Italy, denotes that the ridge was continuous or uninterrupted3
perpetuae mensae (Virg. AEn. VII. 176) are long tables stretching in a
straight line up and down, uninterrupted or unbroken by a transverse
'piece like the trichnium,- perpeluae quaestiones were the courts for the
trial of certain criminal offences, which sat from year to year ‘ without
interruption,' unlike the special commissions appointed from time to
time. Perpetuus and the adverb perpetuo are often employed by
Plautus and Terence, uniformly with the force above explained.
Thus perpetuom diem, Most. III. ii. 78 (76); perpetuam noctem, Rud.
II. iii. 403 triduom perpetuom, Adel. IV. i. 43 biennium perpetuom,
Hec. I. ii. 12; perpetuos decem annos, Stich. Ι. iii. 14, require no ex-
planation. Solt'da et perpetua fides (Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 44) is ‘truth or
honour, firm and uninterrupted.’ When Laches says (Hec. ΙΙ. ἰί.
ῐο), Sz· perpetuam vz's esse affinz'laezlem hanc, he means, ‘if you desire
that this connection between our families should remain unbroken;’
and the same phrase recurs IV. iv. 14. The sentiment expressed
by Auxilium in Cist. I. iii. 46, Vt sunt humana, nihil est perpetuom
datum, is, ‘ nothing goes on steadily without interruption ;' with which
compare Hec. ΙΙΙ. iii. 46. The expression perpetuus modus is peculiar
to Plautus; thus Most. IV. iii. 41 (iv. 41), Te ludrficalus est et me
hodie z'n perpetuom modum, means, ‘he has befooled you and me this
day one after the other, without interruption3’ and again ΙΙΙ. i. 5,
Nunc pol ego perz'z‘ plane z'n perpetuom modum, means, ‘ now am I
evidently undone, and must be ruined without a pause,' ‘without
anything to break or arrest or interrupt my downward career.' In
like manner with regard to the adverb perpetuo, the expression
in Amph. Prol. 60, Nam me perpetuo facere ul sz't comoedia, denotes‚
‘for me to bring it about that this piece should be a comedy from
beginning to end! Again in Epid. I. i. 15, when the slave inquires,
Quid ais? perpetuen, valuisti? he means, ‘have you enjoyed uninter-
rupted good health?' and so again, Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 53, D. Vsquene
valuisti? C. Perpetuo recte, dum quidem z‘llz'c sui, i. e. ‘I enjoyed
uninterrupted good health as long as Iwas there ;' Heaut. IV. viii. 2 1,

perfice hoc mz'hz' perpetuo, Chreme, i. e. ‘without interrupdon! In
