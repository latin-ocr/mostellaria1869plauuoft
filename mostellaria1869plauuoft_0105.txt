METRE AND PROSODY. lxvii

be long or short at pleasme, and a hiatus may be freely admitted;
thus Cas. II. ii. 29, μ
Quin viro aut suptrahat Η aut stupro invenerit,·

and v. 16,
Nec mihi ius meum ΙΙ optinendi optio est,-

and Rud. IV. iii. 12,
Sed boni consili ΙΙ ecquid in te mz'lzz' est,·

where suptrahat, ius meum, and consili, although each is followed by
a vowel, stand for Cretics. In so far as the hiatus is concerned, we
may remark that it is not unfrequently neglected in other parts of

the verse.
The following passage will afford a good example of the Cretic

Tetrameter Acat. ; it is from Cas. ΙΙΙ. ν. 1—

qulla sum, nulla sum ,Ι Tota, tota occidi!

Cor metu mortuom est: membra miserae* tremunt,
Nescio unde auxili, praesidi, perficgz‘

Mi, aut opum copiam comparem aut expetam:
Tanta sactis modo mira miris modis

Intu’ vidi, novam atque integram audaciam.
Cave† tibi, Cleostrata :1 apscede ab isla, opsecro,
Ne quid in te mali faxit z'ta§ percita.

The Cretic Tetrameter Catalectic occurs here and there in detached
lines. Hermann arranges seven in succession in Trin. ΙΙ. i. 17-23,
but several of these cannot be scanned without conjectural emenda-
tions; one presents no difficulty, and may serve as an example—-

Da mihi hoc, mel meum, σι’ me amas, sz' audes ,-

see also what is said below on Most. I. iv.

Cretz'cs combined with Trochees.

Lines are occasionally found in Plautus which belong unquestionably
to the class of Cretics, but which terminate in a peculial· manner.

* F our-th Paeon in 3rd place, unless we pronounce misrae.

† Cave, a monosyllable‚ pronounced Cau.

Ι Cleostrata, a trisyllable‚ pronounced Clostrata.

§ Fourth Paeon in 3rd place. Ita is a conjectural emendation, for the
MSS. have ira, but it is not satisfactory. The next line, which concludes
the speech of Pardalisca, seems to be a Choriambic Tetrameter Acat.‚—

Eripite isti gladium ῗζιαιε sui est impos (mimi.
