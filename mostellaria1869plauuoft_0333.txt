NOTES. 11. ii. 70—III. i. 40. 151

openly,' but to ‘make something evident,' ‘to reveal or disclose some-
thing, as in Poen. Prol. 126, Quod restat, restant alii qui faciant palam,
i. e. ‘who will disclose' or ‘make clear3’ and Truc. IV. iii. 77, ipsa
haec ultro, ut factum est, jecit omnem rem palam, ‘revealed the whole
matter ;' so Heaut. IV. iii. 43, C. Metuo quid agam. S. Metm's? quasi
non ea potestas sit tua Quo velis in tempore ut te exsolvas, rem facias
palm,- and Hec. Ι. ii. 30, ΡΑ, Non est opus prolata: hac percontarier
Desiste. PH· Nempe ea causa ut ne id fiat palam, i. e. ‘that the thing
may not be revealed 3’ and Adel. IV. iv. 16, Sensi ilico id illas suspi-
cari,· secl me reprehendi tamen, Ne quid de fratre garrulae illi dicerem,
ac fieret palam; and so Trin. Ι. ii. 106, with clam opposed in the
preceding clause.

84. Quae res te agitat, T rania κ’] Theuropides says this observing
the anxiety and alarrn, partly real and partly affected, exhibited by
Tranio. So in Men. ΙΙ. ii. 47, Quod te urget scelus!³ in Bac. IV. ii. 2,
Quae te mala crux agitat? cf. also Aul. 1. i. 32, Quae illunc homi-
nem intemperiae tenent? and Epid. ΙΙΙ. iv. 39, Mil. ΙΙ. ν. 24, Quae te
intemperiae tenent?

95. Compare IV. ii. 68 (iii. 45), is vel Herculi conterere quaestum
possiet, and note.

III. i. 39. pilum iniecisti mihi] We have a similar expression in
Epid. V. ii. 25, Tragulam in te inicere adornat: nescio quam fabricam
facit, but in the latter case the phrase represents the perpetration of
some fraud or trick.

40. Hic homo certe est ariolus] i. e. ‘this man is assuredly a wizard.'
Ariolus seems to signify ‘a diviner,' one who knows the truth with
regard to the past, the present, and the future, without reference to
the source from which his knowledge is procured. Thus Amph.
V. ii. 2, Nil est quod timeas: ariolos, aruspices, Mine omnes: quae
futura et quaefacta eloquar; and so Cas. II. vi. 4. Terence also classes
together arioli and aruspices in the general sense of ‘diviners‚' Phor.
IV. iv. 27, znterdixit ariolus Aruspex vetuit ante brumam aliquid
novi Negoti inczpere. Sometimes the word signifies emphatically ‘a
true prophet;' thus Poen. III. v. 46, Eheu quam ego habui ariolos
aruspices, i. e. ‘alas, how 1 have found the Aruspices turn out true
prophets,' referring to the words which he had used at the commence-
ment of the scene3 and so also Rud. II. ii. 20. Sometimes, as in
the passage before us, it is used contemptuously, as when we call
a man ‘ a wizard' or ‘ a conjuror.' Sometimes, since a prophet when
he uttered his predictions was supposed to be excited to frenzy by the
direct influence of a present God‚ ariolus signifies ‘one possessed,'
