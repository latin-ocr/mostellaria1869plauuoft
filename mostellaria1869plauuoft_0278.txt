98 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

17. Οἱς, hercle, paucas tempestates] i. e. ‘within a brief period.' We
have cis employed in the same manner in Truc. II. iii. 27, cis dies
paucos ‚· and in Merc. I. 42, paucos cis menses. In the latter pas-
sage, however, cis is not found in the MSS. but was inserted on
conjecture by Acidalius, and has been admitted by the best editors.
Tempestates paucas is here equivalent to breve tempus. Tempestas
in the singular is used in the sense of tempus in Truc. ΙΙ. iv. 29.
Verum tempestas memini quom quondam sm’t, ‘I remember when there
was a time ;' and in the Prologue (not by Plautus) to the Cas. v. 18,
Ea tempestate flos poetarum fuz't. Elsewhere in Plautus, tempestas,
tempestatem, tempestate, tempestatibus, signisy bad weather‚ a storm,
either with or without a qualifying epithet. In Cicero tempestas, both
m'th and without a qualisying epithet, is used in several passages to
signify ‘fine weather.' Tempestas, weather (bad weather), Amph. ΙΙ.
ii. 58: liquida tempestas, Most. ΙΙΙ. ii. 64 <62): tempestas, a Storm,
I. ii. 27 (24), 57 (52), iii. 6; Rud. ΙΙ. iii. 38, IV. i. 10, iii. 3:

II. iii. 8.

18. Ferratz'lz's is an ἅπ. λεγ.

20. Corrumpe herilem filiunt] So v. 27, corrumpat et rem et filium,
i. e. ‘is leading to ruin‚' and vv. 28, 80, V. ii. 17 (iii. 17). Cf. Merc.
III. ii. 1, Tandem impetravi ut egomet me corrumperem, Empta est amica
clam uxore mea et filio. In the whole of the following passages the
word is applied to leading the young astray, undermining their
principles: corrumpatur, Bac. IV. x. 3 V. ii. 72 ; corrumpi, ΙΙΙ. ἰίἰ. 15,
IV. x. 3; corrupto, III. iii. 16; corruptelae, ‘ruin‚’ As. V. ii. 17;
corruptela, Truc. III. ii. 3; corrumpit, Epid. II. ii. 83, &c., διε.
Amph. Ι. iii. 32, ne corrumpe oculos, ‘do not spoil;’ Mero. III. i. 3,
oculos corrumpis ,j Amph. V. i. 6, corrupta sum, ‘I am undone ;'
Men. IV. ii. 33 and 31, diem corrupit and corrupt, ‘wasted, lost the
day ;’ Epid. Ι. i. 86, plane hoc corruptum est caput, ‘I am utterly
undone;' Pseud. ΙΙΙ. ii. 102, corrumpitur iam cena ,· Trin.11. i. 14,
hominum corruptor ‚· Pers. V. ii. 3, corruptor, ‘that villain?

21. pergraecamz'm'] i. e. ‘play the profligate.’ The stern and
austere old Romans, when they first became acquainted with the
Greeks in Southern Italy, would naturally be shocked by a mode of
life so repugnant to their own habits and prejudices‚ and hence when
they wished to express that a man was indulging in dissolute prac-
tices and embarked on a profligate career, they said that he was
‘playing the Greek.' The word occurs again in this' scene, v. 61,
