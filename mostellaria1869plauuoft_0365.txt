EXCVRSVS 1.—A DEO. 1 81

5. Again, adeo ul, like eo ul, frequently refers to an object kept in
view, a design, a purpose: Rud. V. iii. 31, dandum huc argentum est
probum, Id ego continuo lzuz'c dabo, adeo me ul lu'c emittat manu, i. e.
‘ with the intent that;' Stich. V. iv. 15, Atque adeo ul lu scire possis,
sactum ego lecum divido, ‘ and with the intent that you may be able to
trust in my sincerity‚' διας Aul. III. ii. 27, Adeo ul tu meam sententiam
iam iam noscere possis, i. e. ‘to the intent that you may be able to
become acquainted forthwith with my views,’ ὤας 1V.x. 8, Fateor
peccavisse, el me culpam commeritum scio, Id adeo le oratum advenio
ul animo aequo {grnoscas mihi. The combination here is somewhat
more complicated‚ but this may be designed to express the confusion
and agitation of the speaker; the general meaning is, ‘Ihave come
with the intention of entreating your forgiveness?

III. Adeo equivalent to eo modo, ea ratione, is used for the most part
with an explanatory force, ‘in that way,' ‘thus‚y ‘such being the
case,' ‘therefore,’ ‘then.'

XVhen adeo is translated by ‘therefore’ or by ‘then‚' the former of
these is not to be regarded as necessarily denoting a strict logical
deduction, nor the latter as denoting with emphasis a particular point
of time, but both are used like the Greek οὖν to indicate a sequence
of events, or the continuation of an action or of a narrative, as when
we say, ‘after many dangers therefore Hannibal descended from the
Alps into the plains of Italy,’ ‘let reason then at her own quarry fly,’
‘we first leave childhood behind us, thenv youth, then the years of
ripened manhood, then‘ Sic. There is properly an adverb of place,
then of time, but they are not unfrequently regarded as equivalent.
Thus in the Gospel of St. John, cap. ii. 18, the words ἀπεκρίθησαν
οὖν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι are translated in our authorized version, ‘then answered
the Jews and said unto him,’ but in Wicliffe's Bible, ‘therfor the
jewis answerden and seiden to him3' and this brings us round to
what may be regarded as the original etymological meaning of adeo,
viZ. adea, praem-ea, ‘besideS,y ‘moreoven’

The meanings of adeo which belong to head 111. must be
illustrated by several examples, for they have in many cases ern-
barrassed lexicographers and commentators, and have led to useless
complications, or, not seldom, to the despairing remark, ‘⁴ adeo
abundat‚''' i. e. ‘means nothing ;” Epid. V. ii. 38, P. Dedin lz‘bz'mz'nas

amicam fili fidicinam, Pro lua filia .· islz's adeo le lellgz' lrzginla minis,
