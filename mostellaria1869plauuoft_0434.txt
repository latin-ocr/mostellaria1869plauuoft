246 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

III. Numus s. Numus argenti. It will be seen from the examples
quoted above that the word Numus is occasionally used with re-
ference to the Philippus, but in this case the adjective aureus (or
Philippeus) is usually combined with it, and where these are omitted,
as in Bac. IV. iv. 55, 58, viii. 27, 32, ix. 110, Poen. III. ii. 17, Trin.
IV. ii. 128, 161, the context is such as to leave no doubt that the
Philippus is meant.

But there are several passages in Plautus in which numus cannot
mean the numus aureus or Philippus, indeed the designation numus
argenti is by no means uncommon. e. g. As. II. iv. 80, argenti numum ;
Aul. 1. ii. 30, argenti numos.- cf. v. 34; Pseud. Ι. i. 95, numus argent&
iii. 65, numum argenti.

In such cases it is difficult to discover what sum is indicated.
Moreover doubts have arisen whether the same sum or coin is
uniformly indicated by qumus, and also whether the word is em-
ployed with reference to Greek or to Roman currency.

1. It is used for money in general, or pieces of money, without
special reference to any particular sum or coin: thus Bac, IV. iv. 17,
qum qui numi exciderunt, here, tibi, quod sic terram Optucre.) ‘ you
have not dropped some pieces of money, master, have you?' and so
As. ΙΙ. iv. 34, adducit (sc. trapezitam) domum etiam ultro, et scribit
numos, ‘draws a bill upon him.’

2. Numus or qumus argenti is used to denote a trifling sum:
thus Capt. II. ii. 82, Eum si reddis mihi, praeterea unum numum ne
duis, ‘if you restore to me my son, do not give me a single shilling
in addition (sor your ransom). In Pers. IV. iv. 111 numus abesse hinc
non potest means, ‘I won’t take a shilling less;' just as we had above
quoted from Rud. V. ii. 43, non potest triobolum hinc abesse,· so also
in Most. I. ii. 34 (31), si quid numo sarciri potest, ‘if any desect can
be repaired for a trifle;' cf. Pseud. I. i. 79, iii. 122, v. 91, II. ii. 49,
V. ii. 24; in Epid. V. ii. 35, where the slave offers to take heavy
odds, he says, ni ergo matris filia cst, In meum numum, in tuum
talentum, pignus da, ‘I bet you a numus to a talent ;’ and so III. i. 9.

3. But there can be no doubt that qumus is frequently used to
indicate a piece of money of definite value: thus in Epid. I. i. 52
Stratippocles is represented as haw'ng borrowed a sum of money
at Thebes from an usurer, for which he was to pay at the rate of
a numus per day for each mina,· in Men. ΙΙ. ii. 16, 37, a numus is
named as the price of a young pig fit for sacrifice (porci sacres
sinceri); in Epid. ΙΙΙ, ii. 36 Epidicus proposes to hire the services
os a fidicina for a numus)- in Pers. 1V.vi. 2. when a sum of sixty
