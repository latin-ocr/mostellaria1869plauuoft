xxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

in which it was eventually superseded by e. Among these we find
T onores for Tenores‚ Quintil. Ι. ν. 223 Amplocti for Amplecti, Prisc.
p. 552, Cassiodor. p. 2283. The latter gives Amploctere, Vortere,
Advorsum, and Convellere, Votare for Convellere, Velare. Charis. p. 174,
gives Volurz‘os for Veturios, and this receives some support from the
inscriptions, nn. 1029, 1057, 1082, in which the letters VOT. are usually
interpreted to refer to the Tribus Veturia. Votitam for Vetz'lam is
quoted from Plaut. As. IV. i. 44 by Nonius, p. 455 Volz'm for Velim,
Prisc. p. 848.

Judging from the examples preserved, the form undus instead of
endus was general in gerundives of the third and fourth conjugations
until towards the close of the Republic. Thus we find DE-
FERVNDO, DEICVNDO, FACIVNDVM bis, LEGVNDEIS,
LEGVNDIS, QVAERVNDAI, SCRIBVNDI [12], VENDVN-
DEIS [14 bz’s]‚ LEGVNDEIS [16 bis]‚ REFERVNDVM [17]‚
CAPIVNDEIS [18 ter], DEIVIDVNDA bis, ERCEISCVNDA
bis [19]‚ REFERVNDVM sexies, REFICIVNDVM, FACIVN-
DVM [20]; SAEPIVNDVM, n. 1419; VENIVNDVM, n. 1431,
and so in many other inscriptions, which may be fairly reckoned as
falling within the above limit.

This form however did not prevail to the exclusion of that in endus,
for we find FACIENDAM, EXDEICENDVM, as early as 10, and
COLENDI [13]. Observe also that endus is employed uniformly
in those verbs where the use of the termination undus would have
involved the introduction of uu .· thus TRIBVENDEI [12],
FRVENDVS, FRVENDVM, FRVENDA quinquies, FRVENDEIS
[14], FRVENDEIS [20].

“ Etiam optimus, maximus, ut mediam I literam, quae veteribus
V fuerat, acciperent, C. primurn Caesaris inscriptione traditur fac-
tum.’' Quintil. Ι. O. Ι. vii. 21. This mode of spelling was not
however confined to optumus, maxumus, but extended to all super-
latives which in later times were written with imus. Thus PARI-
SVMA [1]‚ PLOIRVME, OPTVMO [3], FACILVMED [10],
PROXSVMVS [11 ler]‚ PLVRVMAE, PROXVMVS, PROX-
SVMVS quater [12]‚ PROXVMVS bis, INFVMVM ter [13],
OPTVMVS, PROXVMVS, PROXSVMVS octies [14].
