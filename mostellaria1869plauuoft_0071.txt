ORTHOGRAPHY. xli

TERRA; in 5, POSIDET, but also ANNOS; in 6, ANNOS; in
7, ACCVMVLAVI, but the two Cs may here be regarded as
belonging to separate words. In 10 (the S.C. de Bacchanalibus)
the rule is most strictly adhered to; there is no example of a con-
sonant doubled, and between thirty and forty words written with
single consonants where double consonants would have been used
at a later period, e. g. BACANALIBVS, HABVISE, ESENT,
NECESVS, ADIESE, IOVSISET, FECISE, CONPROMESISE,
CONIOVRASE‚ COMVOVISE, &c.

The same holds good of the Polla inscription (B.C. 132), but the
examples are less numerous: MILIARIOS, TABELARIOS, MEI-
LIA bis, SVMA, REDIDEI. In 11, probably a few years later
than the preceding, we find SVFRAGIVM, INTER(C)ESVRVM;
but on the other hand, FERRE, (G)ESSERIT, POSSIDEANTVR.
In 13, IVSERVNT, IOVSERVNT, CASTELI, CASTELVM,
CASTELANOS, APENINVM bis, ANOS, ACIPIANT, CAVSA,
INTRO MITAT, COMVALEM, POSEDET, POSEDENT, PO-
SIDENT ter, POSIDEBIT, POSIDEBVNT ler, POSIDETO,
POSIDERE, PO(SI)DERE; but on the other hand, ANNOS,
ANNI, INMITTERE, ESSENT, ESSE. The name of a place
appears as MANICELVM, MANICELO, and also as ΜΑΝΝΙ-
CELO; MALENT may stand for MALLENT or MALINT. In
12 the preponderance is very decidedly in favour of the doubled
consonant: ATINGAT bis, NECESITVDINE, IVSEI ERVNT,
DIMITERE ; but on the other hand, ANNVM quater, ANNOS bis,
(A)NNOS, ANNEIS bis, ANNIS, CAVSSA bis, ESSE quinquies,
ADESSE ter, ADESSINT, PRAESSE, ATTIGERET, ATTIN-
GAT, OPPEDEIS, POSSIDEANTVR, PROFERRE, SITELLAM,
POSSITVR, 1NTERROGET; and so also in 13. Throughout 13
we have various forms of the verb Possz'dere: POSEDET, POSIDENT,
POSSIDERENT, POSIDEBIT, POSIDEBVNT bis, POSEDEIT,
POSIDETO, POSIDERE bis. In 14, uniformly‚ POSSESIO and
POSSESOR; POSSIDEAT, POSSIDEANT, POSSIDEBIT quin-
quies, POSIDEBVNT, POSSEDERIT, POSSIDERE.

Words ending in B.

It would appear that the letter p approached very closely in sound
to b, especially when the latter stood before *s or t, and hence the
orthography of words in which such a combination occurs became
a matter of doubt and controversy. This is exactly what we might
