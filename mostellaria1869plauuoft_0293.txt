NOTES. I. i. 66—73. 113

and still stronger, Trin. V. ii. 53, L. Satine salve? dic nn'lzi. C. Recte.
‘Is all well? speak. C. All right! 2. Delight, wonder, perplexity;
Poen. IV. ii. 97, Satine, prius quam unum est iniectum telum, tum instat
alterum, i. e. ‘is it not famous to see that before one dart has been
fairly launched a second follows close upon its heels?' In the two
following examples astonishment and perplexity are indicated. Trin.
IV. iii. 63, Mare, terra, caelum, Di vostram fidem, Satin ego oculis
plane vz'deo? estne ipsus, an non est? Merc. IV. i. 16, Satin tu sana es,
opsecro? In Truc. II. vii. 2, Satine qui amat nequit quin nihili sit Atque
improbis se artibus expoliat? the meaning is, ‘is it not strange that
a man in love cannot avoid being good for nothing?' Here, and in
many other passages, W considers that satin and satin est are equi-
valent to nonne, but the full force of satin would in this case be quite
lost. 3. Wrath and indignation‚ mingled with surprise, real or
affected—this is the force of satin in the line of our text, Satin abiit,
neque quod dixi, flocci existumat? i. e. ‘is it possible that he has gone
off ?’ &c.; and so in Mil. II. vi. 1, which is exactly parallel, Satin
abiit ille, neque herile plus negotium Curat, quam si non servitutem
serviat? so also Pseud. V. ii. 19, Satin ultro et argentum aufert et me
irridet? In Trin. IV. iii. 6, satin implies sels-reproach. Cf. Men.
V. ν. 42, Cist. Ι. iii. 2. We now pass on to the combination salin ut,
with respect to which we must distinguish two cases—(a) when satin
ut is followed by the indicative; (b) when satin ut is followed by the
subjunctive. (a) When satin ut is followed by the indicative it is
equivalent to nonne vides ut, i. e. ‘ mark how,’ as in Pers. IV. iv. 106,
Satin ut meminit libertatis? Dabit haec tibi grandes bolos, and may,
according to circumstances, indicate admiration or contempt or sur—
prise. It indicates admiration in Stich. Ι. iii. 114, Sed eccum Dinacium
eius puerum! Hoc vz'a'e ,Ι Satin ut facete atque ex pictura adstitit?
contempt, in Men. Ι. ii. 67, illane, mane, opsecr0‚ hercle: ab se, ecca,
exit. Ah ! solem vides. Satin ut occaecatus est, prae huius corporis
candoribus! surprise, Merc. ΙΙ. iv. 13, E. Tute lzeri ipsus mihi nar-
rasti. C. Satin ut oblitus fui Tibi me narravisse? i. e. ‘is it not won-
derful how I forgot that' etc.; surprise and pleasure in Mil. IV. iii. 41.
There is a slight difference in the combination of the following
passage, where ut is followed by ita, Men. III. ii. 56, Quid hoc negoti
est? Satin ut quemque conspicor Ita me ludificant? ‘What does this
mean? Is it not possible for me to see any one without being
mocked by him ?’ (b) When satin ut is followed by the subjunctive,
as in Bac. ΙΙΙ. iii. 87, Satin ut quem tu habeas fidelem tibi, aut quoi

credas, nescias? i. e. ‘is it to be endured that‚’ ‘is it not abominable
