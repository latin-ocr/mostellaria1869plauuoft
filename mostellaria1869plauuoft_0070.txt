xl PROLEGOMENA.

inscriptions before the death of Caesar ; PERLEGE‚ n. 1009; PER-
LIGE, n. 1306; PELLIGE, n. 10073 SVFRAGIVM [11, 12],
SVFRAGIO [12, 20]; SVBFRAGIA, n. 1492. We find in in-
scriptions ADSIENT, ADFVERIT, ADFVERINT, but there is a
line in Plautus, Poen. I. ii. 67, Aa. flIz'lphio, heus! M'lphzb, ubi es?
M Assum apud te, eccum! A. Ego elixus sis volo: where the pun
would be destroyed if we were to read Adsum instead of Assum.

There is a remarkable sostening of the preposition ad into ar, of
which we have a few examples: thus ARFVISE, ARF(uerunl),
ARVORSVM, all in 10, and ARVORSARIO three times in 12.

Generally speaking, therefore, in printing the text of Plautus it will
be safe to retain the prepositions in composition unchanged, except
in such cases as accipio, where our authorities are all opposed to the
harder form.

Doublz'ng os Semivowels and fllutes.

That the earliest Latin witers did not double the semivowels is
asserted by Quintilian, I. O. I. vii. 14, “ Semivocales non geminare
diu fuit usitatissimi moris,'' words which however do not necessarily
imply that they never doubled them. The same statement is made
more broadly by Festus and his abbreviator Paulus, and they in
several passages extend it to consonants in general, e. g. Fest. s.v.
solitaurilia, p. 293, ed. Mfill„ “quod si a sollo et lauris earum
hostiarum ductum est nomen antiquae consuetudinis, per unum L
enuntiari non est mirum, quia nulla tunc geminabatur litera in scri-
bendo; quam consuetudinem Ennius mutavisse fertur, ut pote Graecus
Graeco more usus, quod illi aeque scribentes ac legentes duplicabant
mutas serni (vocales et lz'quidas);’' and again, s. ν. porigam, p. 218,
“ Porzgam dixisse antiqui videntur pro porrigam propter morem non
ingeminandarum literarum;'⁷ s.v. polet, p. 205, “Polel‚ pollet, quia
nondum geminabant antiqui consonantes.’' So also s.v. lorum, p. 355,
and Paul. Diae. s. vv. anus, p. 6; ab oloes, p. 193 aulas, p. 23.

We have already had occasion to advert to the contradictions and
confusion which prevail among the later grammarians upon this
subject, and therefore we need not now examine their discussions.

Our most ancient inscriptions fully bear out the statement of
Quintilian, provided we admit that the words usnatz'sszmzss moris denote
that the practice, although general, was not invariable. Thus in 1
we have PARISVMA; in 2 we have AVLLA and HISPALLL but
the date of this is by no means certain; in 4, GESISTEI, LICV-
(DSET SVPERASEs, but in the same inscription ESSENT and
