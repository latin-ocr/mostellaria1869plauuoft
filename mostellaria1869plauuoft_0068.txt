xxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

12, 13, 14, but in 14 we have also PECVNIAE once. So we have
OQVOLTOD in 10, PEQVS bis, PEQVDES, but also PECVDES.
PERSEQVTIO‚ OQVPATAM, all in 14; PEQVLAT(V) in 12,
and the blunder PEQVLATVV twice in 16. To these we may
add QVR, n. 1454, QVRA, n. 1006, QVRAVERVNT‚ n. 1428,
PEQVARIORV, n. 1130.

It has been proposed to write the adjective reliquus, where it occurs
in Plautus, as relicuos, because it is in many cases a quadrisyllable;
but this idea receives no support from inscriptions, in which we find
RELIQVEI [20]‚ RELIQVIAE, n. 1009, 1016, RELLIQVIAE,
n. 1051, and different parts of the verb relinquo, q being uniform in
all cases.

T he letter X.

X, the last letter in the Latin alphabet‚ was, according to Isidorus
(1. 4) and Petrus Diaconus (p. 1582), not introduced until the age
of Augustus. But this is an absolute mistake, sor we find SAXSVM
[5], ADVEIXI [9], EXDEICENDVM, EXDEICATIS, EX-
STRAD [10]. Much confusion however appears to have existed
with regard to the exact power of x, and hence we find a great
many examples of PROXSVMVS, MAXSVMVS, VIXSI, DEIXSI,
VXSOR, ALEXSANDER, and the like; and so SAXSVM and
EXSTRAD in the examples quoted above.

The question as to the orthography os Exsilium or Exilium
depends of course on considerations altogether different.

V.

V did not properly belong to the Latin alphabet‚ but was intro-
duced at a comparatively late period to represent Υ in words
transplanted directly from the Greek. We cannot fix vn'th precision
the period when it was first employed in writing, but there is
scarcely a single trustworthy example of it to be found in inscrip-
tions anterior to the death of Caesar, but the Υ in Greek proper
names, and the like, is represented generally by u, and more rarely
by ι’, as in AMVCES, ERVCINA or HERVCINA, GLVCERA,
LVCIOS, ILLVRICVM, PVLADES, SIBVLLA, SVRVS, &c.,
CRISIDA, HIMINIS, SISIPVS. The name HYPOLITVS,

n. 741, Momms.‚ belongs to an inscription certainly not older than
B.C. 21.

There is no reason to believe that such a character was known in
the age of Plautus, and therefore we may sasely eject it wherever it
