The T rochaz‘c Tetrameter Catalectic,

called Septenarius by Cicero (Tuscul. I. 44), and Versus Quadratus
by Aulus Gellius (N. A. ΙΙ. 29), is used very frequently by the Latin
dramatists, especially in those portions of the dialogue which are
characterised by unusual animati0n‚ bustle, or excitement.

The line consists, as the name implies, of seven and a-half feet,
and, in addition to the Trochee and Tribrach, admits the Spondee,
the Dactyl, and the Anapaest in any place except the 7th, where
the Trochee and Tribrach alone are found.

There is a division of the verse at the end of the 4th f00t‚ which
ought thus to end with a vowel, but the Romans observe this rule
much less strictly than in the case of the Iambic Tetr. Cat.

Like the Iambic Tetr. Cat. the verse is Asynartete, and therefore

the last syllable of the 4th foot may be long or short, and hiatus
is neglected. Α
