NOTES. ΙΙ. i. 1—10. 139

dicis, Dz'narclze‚ Et nostram et illorum vicem. This use of vicem is
not however confined to Plautus, but is found in Cicero, Livy, ancl
other writers.

9. Plagzpalz'dae] i. e. qus‘ plagas patiuntur: vox Plautina. It
occurs again in Capt. III. i. 12, where it is applied to parasites, Nz'l
morantur z'cmz Laconas, imi supsellz' viros, Plagz'palz'das, quibus sunl verba
sine penu et pecunia, i. e. ‘men of Spartan endurance.' The word
is in form a patronymic, like rapacidae in Aul. ΙΙ. vii. 8, Rapacz‘darum
ube· lantum siet z'n aedibus, i. e. ‘children of the lash.’ Plautus uses
two other words bearing the same meaning: plagzgren Pseud. Ι. ii. 21,
Huc adhibete aures, quae ego loquar, plagzgera genera hominum, and
plagzgterulus, below IV. i. 19, q. v. Plagzger and plagzgrerulus are
both ἅπ. λεγ.

- Ferrz‘lribax, a hybrid compound from firrum and τρίβως the
pure Latin word is firrzlerus, Trin. IV. iii. 14, Oculz'crepzdae, cruri-
crepzdae, firrz‘teri, maslzgz'cze. Ferrz'lerz'um, below III. ii. 55 q. v. is
equivalent to Ergaslulum, a place which is described in As. Ι. i. 21
’ as Apud sustz'mdz'nas ferricrepinas insulas Vbi vivos homines mortui
incursant boves. All the words given above, firrz'lrz'bax‚ firrz'lerus,
firrz'terz'um, firralilis, ferricrepinas, seem to be ἅπ. λεγ.

10. Fam] This word is thus explained by Non. p. 114 ; “Falae
turres sunt ligneae (Ennius Lib. XV„ ‘Malos defindunl, fiunt tabulata
salaequess') haec sunt in circo, quae apud veteres propter spectatores
e lignis erigebantur.’' Again, Paul. Diac. p. 88, ed. Mun„ “Falcze dicta
ab altitudine, a falando, quod apud Etruscos significat caelum;'’ and

again, ib.‚ “Falarz'ca genus teli missile, quo utuntur ex salis, id est locis ,

exstructis, dimicantes.'’ The falae in the Circus are alluded to by
Juv. S. VI. 590, Consulit ante falas delphinorumque colunmas; and
appear to have been not, as we might infer from the words of
Nonius, elevated wooden structures from which the spectators viewed
the shows, but a row of seven wooden pillars which were ranged
along thespina, and on which were placed the ova, which marked
the courseS. See the commentators on the passage. The falarica is
well known from the description given by Livy XXI. 8 (see too
XXXIV. 14). See also Enn. Ann. 534, ed. Vahlen3 Virg. AEn. IX.
705, and note of Servius3 Lucan. VI. 196; Sil. I. 351, &c. There
is another word which some suppose to be derived from the same
source, viz. falere, found in Varro R. R. III. 5, ξ 14 seqq„ but the
meaning of this term as there employed is very doubtful. With
regard to the etymology proposed by Festus it is difficult to offer

an opinion, but we can scarcely doubt that the same root appears in
