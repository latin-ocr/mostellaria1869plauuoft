cum pedicis* condz'dz'ctlvlzk sz'c hoc grassari gradu. There seems to be
a distinction drawn, in Men. I. i. 3, between catenae and compedes,
the former being a more general term: Homines captivos qui catenis
vinciunt, Et quz'fugdz'vz's serm's indunt compedes,· cf. vv. 8, 9, 10.

catellus is also used by Plautus as a diminutive of calena, as well
as a diminutive of catulus: Cure. V. iii. 13, where Phaedromus is
addressing the leno Cappadox, Delicatum te hodie fizcz‘am cum calello
ut accubes, F erreo ego dico. Catellus in the sense of ‘ a puppy,⁷ Stich.
IV. ii. 40; and catellum, As. III. iii. 103.

The works of Plautus and Terence, of the former especially, are
full of words and phrases applied as taunts to those who had under-
gone the punishments above described3 some of these recur per-
petually, others seem to have been coined on the spot as it were,
and are ἅπ. λεγ. Such are Ver-bero, Mastz'gz'a, F lagz'trz'ba, Plagzjbalzda,
Eumeda, Restio, Crux, Sexcenloplagus, F urczfl’r, T rffurcz' er, Verberea
Statua, Stz'mulorum T ritor, Carnuficz'um cribrum, Genus ferrande,
Ferrz'lrz'buces viri, Plagigera genera hominum, Vlmorum Acheruns.

Whole lines are found composed of such titles, as in Trin. IV.
iii. 14, Oculz'crepidae, cruricmpz‘dae‚ ferriteri, masligz'ae ; and Some-
times two wranglers reciprocate a series of such compliments: As. ΙΙ.
ii. 31, LE. Gumnasz'um flagri salvem. Lz. Quid agis, custos carceris?
LE. O catenarum colone! LI. O virgarum lascivia!

A large collection of such terms of ahuse will be found in Pseud.
1. ii. 1 seqq. and in Pers. III. iii. 13 seqq.

Since the plot in most of the specimens of the New Comedy,
which have been transmitted to us through the medium of the Latin
dramatists, turns upon some trick or mystification, played off gene-
rally by a crafty slave, we might anticipate that the vocabulary of
Plautus and Terence would be well stored with words and expres-
sions denoting roguery.

Accordingly, we shall find the idea of deception presented to us
under a great variety of different forms, many of them highly
ingenious, lively and amusing.
