emphasis, but was equivalent in many cases to the indefinite article a
'or an, which is in reality ane or one, and was anciently employed
just as un, uno, ein, etc. are in modern languages. Plautus will afford
several examples: in this play, IV. ii. 67 (iii. 44), we have Vnus istic
servos est sacerrumus‚· and IV. iii. 9 (iv. 9), Vnum vide· mortuom
effrrifhras; so Capt. ΙΙΙ. i. 22, unum ridiculum affetum,- Epid. III. iv.
1 7, Pol ego magis uuum quaem, i. e. ‘I seek (some) one.’ In Trin. IV.
iv. 1 1. Curre in Piraeum, alque unum curriculum face, which VVeise
explains by saying “ unum pleonastice ut saepius‚'' unum is highly
emphatic, ‘run to the Piraeus and make one course of it,' i. e. ‘do
not halt for a moment.' In Pseud. Ι. i. 52 (q. κη), nunc unae quinque
remorantur minae may signify ‘a matter of five minae,' but unae is
here rather equivalent to solae or solum, ‘now the balance os five minae
alone detains me here ;¹ and so lres unos passus, Bac. IV. vii. 34.

147. Ducere, Duclare, circumducere, Perduclare, Perduclor, all
occur in the same sense in the course os this play. In Pers. IV.
iv. 85, Omne ego pro m'lu'lo esse ducto quodsue't quando suit, the MS.
reading ducto in this sense is an ἅπ. λεγ. W reads duco.

III. ii. 10. Tota turget mz'lzz' uxor] i. e. ‘is all in a ferment.’
There is a line in Cas. II. v. 17 which may serve as a commentary‚
qunc infirmenlo tota csl, ita turget msln'.

12. cubandum esl mala] The same expression in As. IV. ii. 87,
filule cubandum est: iudicatum me uxor adducit domum.

79. Quasi flagz'lalor] i. e. ‘like a dun) See note on v. 55.

110. Sibi quisque ruri metit] A proverbial expression equivalent
to ‘ every one for himself in this world' or ‘ charity begins at home!
Compare Epid. II. ii. 80, Mihi 2'slz'c nec serz'lur nec melfium i. e. ‘I
have no interest in that matter, it does not concern me.’

111. Redlzibcre is a technical legal term employed when a
purchases returns the article purchased upon the hands os the seller
on account os some defect. The explanation of Ulpian is persectly
distinct (Digest. XXI. 1, ᾧ 21), “Redln'bere est facere ut rursus habeat
venditor quod habuerit;'' and so Festus p. 270, ed. Mun„ where
however the text is somewhat corrupt. The act of returning an
object under these circumstances was called Redlzz‘biteb, and a suit
brought to compel the seller to receive the object and to return
the price was Actio Redhibilorz'a, and so Iudicium Redhz'torz'um. See
Digest. XXI. 1, ξ 18, 48, 54, 60; see also Quintil. LO. VIII. 3,
ξ 14 ς Aul. Gell. IV. 2, XVII. 6. Plautus employs the word again,
Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 84, Dz'xz't se redhibere sz' non placeat, i. e. ‘ he (the
purchaser) said that he would return her if she did not give
