ORTHOGRAPHY. xxix

furei mendacez', perhaps to distinguish it from the ablative mentienti*
There is no reason to suppose that the proposals of Lucilius were
ever accepted and recognised in practice; the use of ez· for ι’ gra-
dually, although slowly, fell into disuse‚ and to the last we find no
consistency.

There are however a few words in which, for a long period, εἰ
was uniformly employed.

Foremost among these is the relative Qui, which, both in the nom.
sing. and nom. pL, appears almost invariably as Quez' down to the
beginning of the eighth century.

QVEI in the nom. sing. occurs upwards of two hundred times in
the inscriptions 1-19; QVI once only, viz. in 13 (B.C. 117). In
20 QVEI occurs about fifty times, QVI twice.

QVEI in the nom. pl. occurs ⁴about sixty times in 1—20, QVI once
only, viz. in 13. QVEIQVOMQVE (sing. and pl.) appears first in
11, and in inscriptions 11-20 about twenty-six times without variation.
SEI for SI occurs upwards of seventy times in 1-20; SI once only,
viz. in 14. QVASEI is found in 11, 12, 16, in all seven times;
QVANSEI‚ apparently a blunder,† in 14; QVASI never. VTEI
appears first in 10, and in the inscriptions 10-20 upwards of ninety
times; VTI occurs five times, commencing with 11. In the in-
scriptions 10-20‚ IBEI, VBEI, NEI, NEIVE, occur more fre-
quently than IBI, VBI, NE, NEVE, but ΙΒΙ, NE, NEVE are by
no means uncommon.

CEIVIS seems to have long maintained its ground. It is found
in 10, and in the inscriptions 10—14 CEIVIS and its cases, spelled
with ei in first syllable, occur about fourteen times; CIVES appears
for the first time in 16.‡ CEIVITATE occurs four times in 12.
So in the inscriptions 11—19 DEICO occurs nearly thirty times:
viz. DEICAT three times, DEICERENT once, DEICET eight
times, DEICITO eleven times, DEICVNTO twice, DEICERE
once, DEICEI twice, DEICVNDO once. DICERE, DICITO
appear first in 20; the forms DIXI and DEIXI, with their
derivatives, were used indifferently.

* Varro also appears to have attempted to lay down rules upon the
segne subject (Terent. Scaur. l.c.), but the words of Scaurus are very
o scure.

† [Does not this spelling rather afford a trace of the original form
of the word, quam si !—ED.]

Ι CIVIBVS is quoted from 14, but there is a flaw in the tablet at the
commencement of the word. - <
