METRE AND PROSODY. li

wherever any obstacle presents itself, a process literally Procrustean
is forthwith resorted to, and short limbs are pulled out and long
limbs cut short without compunction.

If, before going further, we endeavour to ascertain what the
ancients thought on this matter, we shall find that those who were
best qualified to judge were blind to the extreme skill and grace
which some modern critics have discovered in the Iambic Trimeter
of the comic writers, and it is amusing to contrast the expressions
of Cicero and Ritschl.

The former, Orat. LV. ξ 184——“ At comicorum propter similitu-
dinem sermonis sic saepe sunt abiecti senarii, ut nonnumquam vix
in eis numerus et versus intelligi possit.''

The latter, when arguing against the admission of the hiatus under
certain circumstances, exclaims indignantly, “Et hoc ut artis fuerit?
et Plautinae artis, cuius tantam in reliquis partibus senariorum sep·
tenariorumque condendorum omnibus elegantiam merito admiramur ?”
And yet Cicero was certainly familiar with, and greatly admired, the
early literature of his own country, and was moreover an accom-
plished Greek scholar.

Again, Horace, although jealous perhaps of the blind admiration
evinced by some of his contemporaries for the older Latin writers,
would scarcely have ventured to attack the ‘numeri’ of Plautus so
decidedly had they in reality been regarded generally as saultless.
See Ep. II. i. 58, 170 sqq„ A. P. 54, 270.

From Priscian we learn that even in his time there were persons,
we must suppose with some pretensions to learning, who asserted
that there were no metres at all in Terence, while others pretended
that they were of a mysterious‚ recondite character, and known to
themselves alone. In the MSS. much confusion prevails as to the
arrangement of lines, and the editor of the Editio Princeps seems to
have been almost completely ignorant os the subject, and in many
cases to have made scarcely an attempt to distribute the words
into verses.

Now although many difficulties present themselves when we
proceed to scan particular lines, and although much diversity of
opinion exists with regard to the precise laws which the dramatists
imposed upon themselves in constructing their verse, it must be
observed that, except in some particular cases to be noticed below,
there is no more difficulty in determining the classes and species os
verse employed than in the works of Virgil and Horace. We can
assert with absolute certainty that, for the most part, the ordinary·
