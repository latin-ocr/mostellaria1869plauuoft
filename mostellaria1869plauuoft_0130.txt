lxxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

εῐιῖΐι, v. 1 19,
Nunc si ille huc salvos revenit reddam sm sibi.

The letter u coalesces occasionally with the vowel following in the
words duo quatuor,· both forms, ditos and dte—os, occur in the same pas-
sage in Most. III. ii. ¹47 (145) and 149 (147) (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Viden pictum ubi ludtficatur cornix una volturios ditos?
Cornix astat, ea volturios duos vicissim vellicat,-

so Trin. ΙΙΙ. iii. 45 (Senar.),
Dzvz‘s ἔῖιῖς nos consignemus quasi sint a patre,·

Truc. II. ii. 52 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Quisquam homo mortalis posthac offiium rerum creduit‚·

Poen. IV. ii. 75 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

De praedone Siculo. Μ. Quanti? S. Duodeviginti minis.
M. Du—as illas duodevzgrz'nti? S. Et nutricem earum tertiam,

where we must pronounce duas as a monosyllable: duodevzgrinti may
in each line be regarded either as a sexsyllabic or quinquesyllabic
word: in the one case the first three syllables will form an Anapaest,
in the other a Spondee ; Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 121 (1 17) (Senar.),

Qudtuor minae perierunt plane, ut ratio redditur,

it will be observed that quatuor is a trisyllable with the first
syllable long.
Fuit is a monosyllable Truc. ΙΙ. i. 7 (Iamb. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Dum szt, dedit: nunc nihil habet: quod habebat, nos habemus.

We have thus seen that the principle of synizesis, of which we find
occasional examples in the writings of the Augustam poets‚ was em-
ployed to a far greater extent, and in a much bolder manner, by the
early dramatists. But Ritschl, while in his eagerness to establish the
purity and correctness of the metres of Plautus he would deprive
him of those licences in which the most fastidious versifiers have
indulged, is in some particulars m‘lling to grant him an amount of
license from which the most careless would have shrunk. In sup-
port of the theory that the dramatists were in many cases indifferent
to the Rule of Position, he adduces a number of examples to prove
that such words as peristromata, expapillato, satellites, „cupellam trapezeta,
