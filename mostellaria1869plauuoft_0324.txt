1 42 PLAV TI MOSTELLARIA.

page will supply examples. The only passage in any classica] writer
in which intro does not irnply motion is in Cato R. R. 57 ξ 7, who,
when descanting on the virtues of pickled cabbage, declares, Et si
bz'lt's alra est, el εἰ lienes turgent, el sz' cor dolel, el si iecur, aul pulmones,
aul praecordia, uno verbo omnt‘a sana faciel intro quae dole‘tnbunt,
although he had said in the previous sentence, Siquid antea mali
inlus erit. Forcellini quotes a passage from Palladius I. 40, ut sz'
pilam miseris, intro stare non possit, where, however, the difficulty is
removed by a slight change in the punctuation, which ought to be,
si pilam miseris intro, stare non possit.

48. eveniant] So the MSS. Nonius (p. 509) quotes a line from
the Hecuba of Ennius in which he employs evenat for evem'at, and
hence Both. and R would here read evenant, but the introduction
of this form here is altogether uncalled for. Cf. Cure. I. i. 39;
Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 105, ΙΙΙ. i. 25 Trin. I. ii. 3; in some of which the change
may be made with propriety. See also pervenanl‚ Rud. III. ii. 12 ς
Trin. 1. ii. 56.

54. mutire] ‘to speak even in a whisper.' Mulio or muttio signifies
properly ‘to speak through compressed lips,' and hence ‘to speak
in a whisper,’ and sometimes ‘to mutter' or ‘ grumble,' as in Amph.
Ι. i. 225, M. Etiam mutis .> S. Iam tacebo. Occasionally it is used
humourously with regard to inanimate objects‚ as in Curc.1. i. 20,
of a door (oslium), Belle'ssumum hercle vidi el tacz'turnzlvsumum, qum-
quam ullum verbum mulz'l: quom aperitur, lace& and again, v. 93, Vide!
ul aperiuntur aedes sestivissumae ! Non mulz'l cardo .· so also neu virgae
mutiam, Poen. Prol. 18. Other examples of mutire will be found in
Amph. I. iii. 22; Bac. IV. vii. 2; Men. V. i. 113 Mil. II. vi. 83;
Pers. V. ii. 46 ; Andr. III. ii. 25. In one passage in Terence, Hec.
V. iv. 26, mutire must signify ‘to be silent :' P. Dic mz'lu', harum rerum
num quid dt‘xlz' iam patri? B. Nihil. P. Neque opus est: Adeo mutilo.-
placet non fieri hoc iffdem, ul in comoediis Omnia omnes ubi resciscunt .·
&c., where adeo mutilo must mean ‘be silent then’ or ‘ remain silentl*
We have also a substantive mutilio in Amph. I. iii. 21, a line which
we have quoted above in the note on I. i. 33. The frequentative
form musso is found in Aul. II. i. 12, Neque occullum id haberi neque

* F reund takes this quite differently; he seems to suppose that mutito
is the ablative of the participle, and would construe neque opus est adeo
mutito, ‘there is no need of whispering it about ;’ but if that were the
construction it would rather mean, ‘there is no need of speaking about it
in a whisper‚’ i.e. ‘you may speak openly if you please,' which is directly
the reverse of the obvious sense of the passage. Δ
