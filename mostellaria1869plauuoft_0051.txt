ORTHOGRAPHY. xxiii

III. Inscriptions.

By far the most reliable and authoritative evidence on questions
of early Latin orthography is afforded by inscriptions. The only
sources of fallacy, in so far as inscriptions are concerned, may be
classed under four heads :

1. The mistakes made by the original engravers on the stone or
metal.

2. The mistakes made by the scholars who have transcribed
them.

3. The difficulty of ascertaining the exact period at which they
were engraved.

4. The genuineness of the inscriptions themselves.

The mistakes made by the engravers are sor the most part obvious,
are not numerous, and but few of them affect the questions under
consideration.

The great care taken and exertions made by modern scholars to
arrive at perfect accuracy in representing the originals, has in a great
measure removed any difficulties which might have embarrassed one
from this quarter. Still the necessity of care is rendered obvious by
the errors pointed out, and the corrections introduced by each new
copyist, and the difficulty of arriving at absolute accuracy is proved
by the variations—trifling it is true, but still variations—presented in
almost all the different editions of the inscription on the tomb of
the Scipios. So also in transcribing from the original capitals into
ordinary type, the eye and hand, however practised, will some·
times fail.

In the case of almost all the inscriptions we have selected and
enumerated below, the date is clearly ascertained, within very narrow
limits, by internal evidence.

The genuineness of only one of the series has been seriously
impugned by Maffei, but the concurrent testimony of scholars is in
its favour.

[To the evidence of inscriptions, therefore, so far as these will
serve us, we must betake ourselves in the first instance, if we desire
to arrive at any certain knowledge as to those archaic forms by
which we must suppose the spelling of Plautus to have differed from
that of the later writers. In all cases where we can collect from
genuine inscriptions a sufficient number of undoubted instances to
justify the inference that a particular mode of spelling either a single
