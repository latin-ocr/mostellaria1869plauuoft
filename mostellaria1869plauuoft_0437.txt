EXCVRSVS X1V.-TALENT VM, MJNA, ιζϊ. 249

with reference to their own currency, signifies κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, the ll'umus
sestertius. But the daily pay of the Roman soldier was certainly
not three Sestertiz' at this period.

2. Plautus, Pseud. Ι. i. 95, makes Calidorus say, Quid ego m' flcam
Quoi nec paratus numus argenti siet, [Veque cui lz'bellae Spes sl'l nsquam
genlz'zcm,· from which we naturally infer that the numus argemz' is
something different from the libella. But the Le'bella, according to
Varro (L. L. V. ξ 174, ed. Muli), was a small silyer coin equal in
value to the copper As. Hence we may translate, ‘I, who have not
got a shilling in my pocket, and have no hope of procuring a penny
anywhere.' It is quite true that libella is employed elsewhere (as it
is indeed here) by Plautus in the same sense as triobolum and numus,
to denote indefinitely a trifling sum, as in Cas. ΙΙ. v. 8, Quod si lu
nolis, filiusque eliam tuus, Vobis z'nz'ilek alque amborum z'ngralt'tlv Vna
libella liber possum fierz',·* and that when Hegio says, Capt. V. i. 27,
At ob eam rem ml'lzi libellam pro eo argenle' ne dm's, the meaning is
precisely the same as when he says, ΙΙ. ii. 81, Eum si reddis mihi,
praeterea unum numum ne dudm· but our object at present is to ascer-
tain whether the value of the numus, when used by Plautus to denote
a specific sum or coin, is constant or variable.

3. Lastly, as to the passage Most. II. i. 10. When Lipsius and
others assert that the words trium numerum causa refer to the daily
pay of the Roman soldier, even if we were to admit that the words
really allude to the pay of the Roman soldier, it is a pure assumption
to take it for granted that his dailv pay is meant. Supposing the tres
numi equivalent to six drachmae or six denarii (for, as we remarked
above, the Roman writers are wont to regardv the drachma and the
denarius as equivalent), the lres numi would be equal to 60 asses, or two
asses per day for a month. That this may have actually been the pay
of the Roman soldier when Plautus wrote is by no means improbable,
since it was only two obols or 3 ,¹3- asses per day in the time of Polybius,
although the wealth of Rome and the importance of her armies had
increased enormously during the interval. This is a mere conjecture,
and may be taken sor what it is worth, but we must bear in mind
that we have no proof whatsoever that the words of Tranio refer to
the pay of a Roman soldier. That three numi were occasionally given

* So again, Pseud. 11. ii. 34, ‘Tibi libellam argenti numquam credam. No
specimen of the Libella having ever been found, some numismatologists
have most unreasonably maintained that there never was such a coin ; but
the words of Varro (l.c.) are perfectly distinct—“Numi denarii decuma
libella, quod libi-ain pondo aeris valebat, et erat ex argento parva.’'
