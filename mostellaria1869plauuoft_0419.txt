EXCVRSVS XL—PR OB VS, PR OBE. 2 3 1

that the person spoken of is merely ‘good of his kind 3¹ as Poen. V.
iii. 6, Praestzgriator lzic quidem Poenus probus est, ‘this Carthaginian
is a capital juggle13’ and Most. I. iii. 86, Olz probus homo sum, Quae
pro me causam diceret patronum liberavi, ⁴ I am a knowing fellow.’

Probus, when applied to inanimate objects, denotes that they are
‘ good of their kind :⁷ thus Most. III. ii. 41, Vinu et victu piscatu probo
electili‚· and Rud. ΙΙΙ. v. 19, D. I dum, T urbalio, curriculo adfer buc
foras Duas clavas. L. clavas.) D. Sed probas, ‘ but see that they
are good (stout) ones!

Probe, the adverb, is applied to any act or work performed in a
satisfactory manner: Most. Ι. ii. 19 (18), Factae (sc. aedes) probe,
examussim, i. e. ‘well-constructed;’ so Men. III. ii. 1, Potin ut
quiescas, si ego tibi hanc (sc. pallam) hodie probe Lepideque concinnatam
referam temperi? again, As. IV. i. 10, scribas vide plane et probe,
‘see that you write it distinetly and eorrectly;' and Most. III. ii. 47,
Nos prcffecto probe, ut voluimus, viximus, ‘we have lived well,' that is,
‘lived a pleasant life ;' and in the same play, I. iv. 29, Probe quin amabo
accubas, Delphium mea, ‘ place yourself comfortably—-at your ease.y

There is however a modification of the meaning of probe which
deserves especial notice, since it occurs very frequently in the
dramatists. It is employed to denote that an action has been or
will be performed completely and in the best manner. while the action
itself may or may not be praiseworthy‚ and in this sense the force
of the word may frequently be correetly conveyed by the English
‘thoroughlyz' thus Amph. III. iii. 20, Qui me Amphitruonem rentur
esse, errant probe, ‘are thoroughly or completely mistaken5' so Trin.
III. iii. 88, Eumque huc ad adulescentem meditatum probe Menam,
‘ thoroughly schooled 3’ again, Most. Ι. i. 4, Ego pol te ruri, si vivam,
ulciscar probe,· and V. 1. 19 (ii. 4), Quoius ego liic ludificabo corium, si
vivo, probe,· and Bac. III. iii. 94, Affatim est, Asnesihche, cura et con-
castiga hominem probe,· and Cas. Ι. 36, Ita te adgerunda curvom aqua
factam probe, Vt postilena possit ex te fieri, ‘I will render you so
thoroughly crooked that a saddle-tree (frame of a packsaddle) may
be made out of you ;’ so Bac. IV. iv. 50, Emungam hominem probe
bodie, ‘I will befool;’ Most. V. i. 59 (ii. 44), probe me emunxti,-
Trin. IV. ii. 51, ludam hominem probe‚· Amph. III. iv. 14, 22, saxo
probe iam hic deludetur,· and in the passage referred to from Capt.
ΙΙ. ii. 19, usque admutilabit probe.

Plautus uses also the form adprobe in Trin. IV. ii. 115, Mihi con-
crederet, nisi me ille et ego illum nossem adprobe, but it seems to be an
ὄπ. λεγ. The word is mentioned by Aul. Gell. VII. 7.
