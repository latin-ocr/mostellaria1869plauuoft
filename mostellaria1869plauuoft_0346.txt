1 64 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

from this play, the following will serve to illustrate the origin of these
phrases and the manner in which they are used: Capt. III. iv. 120,
Satin me illi hodie scelesti capti ceperunt dolo, where there is a sort of
pun on capti (prisoners) and ceperunt ,· so Bac. V. ii. 88, Lepide ipsi
hi sunt capti, suls qui filiis ficere insidias .· ite,· and Pseud. IV. iii. 1 1,
flletuo autem, ne herus redeat etlam dum a foro, Ne capta praeda capti
praedones suanm Epid. III. ii. 2 3, iam tpse cautor captus est. Capto
signifies ‘to lie in wait for;’ Amph. Ι. i. 266, Quid me captas, car-
nufexz> i. e. ‘why are you trying to catch me by your questions?’
ΙΙ. ii. 163, Me captas, ‘ you are trying to ensnare me ;’ and in vss 189,
capto is distinguished from capio, Tu si me impudicitiae captas, non
potes capere, i. e. ‘if you are endeavouring to lead me into a snare,
and convict me of unchastity, you are not able to entrap me ;' and
in Epid. II. ii. 31, eos captabant signifies ‘they were watching to
ensnare thern ;' in v. 1 12, Verum, si plus dederis, referam .· nihil in ea
re captio est. So captio est, Truc. ΙΙ. vii. 65, ‘that is not fair;’ and
As. IV. i. 45, captiones metuis, ‘you are afraid of having tricks
played off upon you.’

27. Nunc ego me illac per posticum ad congerrones corfiram] There
seems to be no doubt that the word congerrones signifies ‘ jolly com-
panions,' ‘mateS,’ or something equivalent. It occurs again below,
V. i. 8, Capio consillum ut senatum congerronum convocem ,· and in
Pers. 1. iii. 9, Iam pol ille lzz'c aderit, credo, congerro meus. Non., p. 1 18,
quotes the line srom the Persa and explains it, ‘ ut conlusor meus qui
easdem exerceat nugas.' Gerro is found in Heaut. V. iv. 10, gerro,
iners, fraus, helluo Ganeo, damnosus. Observe also the word gerres
denoting ‘sprats' or some small, worthless fish. The etymology
is altogether uncertain. Varro, L. L. VII. 55, who also quotes this
line, says, “Congerro a gerra et Graecum est, et in Latina cratis.'’
The Greek form with which we are acquainted is γέῤῥον, and signifies
‘ anything made of wicker-work,' thus answering closely to cratz's, but
the connection with congerro is by no means obvious. Gerrae is used
several times by Plautus in the sense of ‘ stuff and nonsense,' ‘ bosh,'
‘ trash ;’ e. g. Poen. Ι. i. 8, ,Nam tuae blanditiae mihi sunt, quod dici
solet, Germe germanae, atque edepol λῆροι λήρων; and so gerrae max-
umae, in Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 49: frequently it is simply an exclamation, as in
Trin. III. iii. 31, and As.111. iii. 10. The word reappears in Ausonius,
in the preface addressed to Symmachus, prefixed to Eidyll. XI.
lllz'si itaque ad te frivola gerris Siculis vaniora, where by the epithet
Siculis he evidently alludes to the foolish story told in Paul. Diac.
(s.v. Germe, p. 94, ed. Miill.) to explain how gerrae, supposing it to
