NOTES. v, i. 4, 5-11. 32. 173

sale of a free Greek damsel to a leno under the pretext that she
had been kidnapped and brought from the most remote regions of
Arabia, the terms on which she is offered for sale expressly exclude
mancupatio (IV. iii. 55), Ac suo periclo is emat, quz· eam mercabitur,
Asancupio neque promittet, neque quisquam dabit, and therefore Dor-
dalus at first objects to the proposal, Nihil milzi opus est Litibus neque
tricis .· quamobrem ego argentum numerem foras Β Nisi mancupio accipio,
quid eo mihi opus mercimonio? but when he is at last persuaded he is
reminded (iv. 40), Prius dico hanc mancupio nemo tibi dabit, and after
the price has been settled, v. 113, Tuo periculo sexaginta haec datur
argenti minis‚· and when eventually the trick is disclosed he is obliged
to acquiesce in the loss of his money, glad to escape a prosecution
for trafficking in free maidens. So in Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 112, Charinus en-
deavours to avoid selling Pasicompsa by urging that he has no legal
title, Non ego illam mancupio accepi. See Cure. IV. ii. 8, V. ii. 19 ;
Bac. I. i. 59 tibi me emancup0‚ ‘I make myself over to you absolutely 3'
and so Mil. I. 23.

32. Hic ego libi praesidebo: ne interbitat quaestio] i. e. ‘lest the
examination should sall through‚’ i. e. ‘should fai1‚' where interbitat
is equivalent to intereat. The simple verb bila which seems to have
the same force as eo, both as a simple verb and in composition, is
found once or twice in Plautus. Thus Cure. I. ii. 51, Qui me in terra
aeque fortunatus erit, si illa ad me bitem and Merc. II. iii. 127, Ad
portum ne bttas, dico iam tibi. C. Auscultabitur. Bitat in Mil. IV.
ii. 7 is a conj. emend.; so also bitere in Pseud. Ι. iii. 23. We find
also several compounds; Capt. II. iii. 20, Si non rebitas huc, ut vi-
ginti minas Dem pro te (rebitaszredeas) ; ΙΙΙ. iv. 72, lVamque edepol si
adbites propius os denasabit tibi (adbiteszadibzs); Rud. II. vi. 1 1, Vtinam
le prius quam oculis vidissem meis, Malo cruciatu in Siciliam perbi-
teres (i. e. perires) ; Stich. IV. ii. 28, Νοη it, non it, quia lanto opere
suades ne ebitat, where ebitat would be admissible; Pseud. ΙΙΙ. i.
12, Eum cras cruciatu maxumo perbitere (perbitere :periturum esse) ,·
Poen. V. iii. 44, A. Quid, si eamus illis obviam Β H. At ne inter vias
Praeterbitamus, metuo, where praterbitamus would be admissible. In
all the above passages except two the penultimate of bito must be
long; in the two excepted the long quantity is equally admissible,
and therefore there can be no doubt as to the quantity.* Nonius,

* There is yet another example in Plautus, viz. abitat, which is quoted
by Freund as abito.- the line is in Rud. 111. iv. 72, Hunc quoque adserva
ipsum, ne quo abitat, nam promisimus, which is a Troch.Tet1·. Cat„ and
scansion demands that we should pronounce abnat.
