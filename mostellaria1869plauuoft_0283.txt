NOTES. Ι. i. 35—43. 103

41. Olera] The verse requires that we should shorten the
penultimate syllable. Priscian p. 838 recognises the double form
of this verb, and quotes the line before us as an example, ‘Oleo, oles,
et olo olis. Plautus in Mostellaria, lVon omnes possunt olere unguenta
exotica nam nisi corripias penultimam Iambus stare non potest.' He
quotes also a line of Afranius and repeats his observation in p. 866.
So Nonius (p. 147, s. v. olat) quotes the same line from Afranius as
an example of olat, Non potest quin illa stacta longeque et multis olat ,·
and olant is found in Poen. Ι. ii. 56. On ‘the other hand, the
‘ common form of the verb occurs in the next line, oles, and in 1. iii.
121, Quid oleant nescias nisi id unum ut male olere intellegas, we must
have penultimate long, otherwise the trochaic measure would be
vitiated.

43. lVeque tam facetis, quam tu vivis, victibus] i. e. ‘ delicate.' The
idea originally involved in facetus has nothing to do with wit or
humour, but, supposing it to be derived from facio, is ‘dextrous,'
‘handy,' ‘clever‚’ ‘agree—able: and it seems to be properly applied as
an epithet to anything done gracefully, indeed ‘graceful’ would in a
great number of cases accurately represent the meaning. We see
this force of the word exemplified in Hor. S. I. x. 44, molle atque
facetum Virgilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae ,· in Ep. I. vi. 55
it is equivalent to ‘ affable’ or ‘courteous,‘'Frater, Pater, adde,· Vt cuique
est aetas, ita quemque facetus adopta‚· and in the sense of ‘graceful‚
delicate pleasantry' with strong irony in Sat. Ι. ii. 26, Malthz'nus
tunicis demz'ssis ambulat: est qui Inguen ad obscaenum subductis usque
facetus ; but when in Sat. I. iv. 7 he characterises Lucilius as sa-
cetus, Emunctae naris, the meaning will be ⁶ clever' or ‘ witty and keen
scented.' Even when applied directly to conversation facetus by no
means always implies humour; thus, when Cicero De Off. I. 29
divides humour into two species (duplex iocandi genus), he characterises
one of them as elegans, urbanum, ingeniosum, facetum, where facetus
must signify ‘delicate' or ‘gracefuls So also lustin. XXXIX. 25, speaks
of faceti ioci. In like manner facete in Plautus frequently signifies
simply, ‘cleverly,’ ‘agreeably‚' ‘aptly‚' ‘to the purpose.' Thus.
Asin. III. ii. 35, Vt adsimulabat Sauream med esse, quam facete!
Capt. ΙΙ. ii. 26, Vt facete orationem ad servitutem contulit,· I. ii. 73,
H. Quia mi est natalis dies, Propterea te vocari ad cenam volo.
E. Facete dictum! (somewhat different in Poen. III. iii. 24, where it
means ‘a well-expressed sentiment ;’) Mil. Ι. i. 39, Facete advortis
animum tuum ad animum meum ‚· and II. vi. 58, III. iii. 33, IV. iv. 5,
25. Pers. II. v. 22, S. Dominus me boves mercatum Eretriam mz'sil‚
