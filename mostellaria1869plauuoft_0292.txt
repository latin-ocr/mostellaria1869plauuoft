1 1 2 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

i. e. ‘all kinds of fish;’ and from Turpilius, si flabat Aquilo aut
Auster inopia lum erat piscati, i. e. ‘there was a scarcity os fish.' We
may remark that we use the word fishing in a double sense in
English, when we say ‘he is gone a-fishing‚' and ‘he has had a
good fishing,’ meaning ‘a good haul of fish;' but we cannot with
any accuracy employ the word fishz'ng to denote the fislz captured.

66. oplue're] The verse requires that the penultimate should here
be short, and hence the verb is θρίων,- but in ΙΙΙ. ἱί. 151 (150),
oplufere from oplueor; and in III. ii. 154, opluerz'er,· and so again in
Amph. III. ii. 195 opluere in Bac. IV. iv. 18, but the text and scansion
of the line are doubtful; opinetur, Mil. IV. vi. 56. The simple tuor
is in the received text of Trin. III. ii. 82, Elz'am ob stultitiam tuam
te tueris τ’ mullam abomina, where tueris is an anapaest; and in Lucret.
IV. 449, Omnia quae tuimur fieri lum bina luendo ,· and again IV. 362.
So contai is found below III. ii. 152 (151), and in As. Ι. i. 111,
III. i. 203 contuor, As. ΙΙ. iii. 23, Pers. ΙΙ. ii. 26; z'nluor, Most. ΙΙΙ.
ii. 150 (149); intueor, Rud. ΙΙ. iv. 28; intuetur, Capt. III. iv. 25,
Truc. ΙΙ. vii. 40; intuentur, Bac. V. ii. 12 ; inluerz‘, Truc. Ι. ii. 58;
intuens, Eun. III. v. 32; z'nluz'tur‚ Heaut. II. iv. 23. Festus, although
his text is here imperfect, seems distinctly to recognise the double
form, luor and tueor, and says that when he wrote they were used
indifferently; but we find nothing in the old writers to support his
notion that tuor originally was equivalent to video and tueor to deflndv.
See Fest. and Paul. Diae. pp. 354, 355, ed. Mun.

67. G. Pol tz'bz· istuc credo nomen actutum fhre. Τ. Dum interea
sic sit, istuc “actutum” sina] So I. iv. 24 (25), Philolaches says,
“ Iam revortar,- to which Philematium replies, Dz'u est “ iam’' id mihi.

72. Ne lu erres, hercle, praelerhac mz'ln‘ non facies moram] So
anlehac, III. ii. 42 3 Imo vila antehac erat, and anlt'dlzac, Amph. II.
ii. 79, Cist. I. i. 1.

73. Salin abiel] Salz'n is frequently employed by Plautus, not
merely as a simple interrogative, but also to express strong emotion,
anxiety, surprise, and indignation. It is used both alone and also in
combination with ul and sz'. We shall give examples, explaining as
we go along. 1. Simple interrogation: Stich. IV. i. 13, Sed salin
ego lecum paczficalus sum, Anlszhofi i. e. ‘have Ι made my peace with
you sufficiently ?’ Most. I. iii. 10, Contempla, amabo, mea Scapha, satin
baec me veslz's deceat:> i. e. ‘look and tell me, Scapha, whether this
dress becomes me well enough? and similar examples will be found
in Most. I. iii. 125; Pers. Ι. i. 183 Merc. II. iv. 27; Men. IV. ii. 52,
V. i. 41. In Men. IV. ii. 38. Satin audis? is a very earnest question,
