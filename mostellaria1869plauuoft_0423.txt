EXCVRSVS X11.-NJMIS‚ NIMIVS, (ἔτ. 23 5

4. le‘mz'o as an adverb. [Vimio is used adverbially in clauses in
which comparison is expressed or implied. ⁴

(a) In the great majority of instances it is combined with the
comparative degree of an adjective or adverb: thus Most. Ι. 1., 69,
nimio celerius, ‘ more quickly by far3' ii. 66 (60), nimio nequior,
‘worse by far5' II. ii. 12, nimio expeclalim‘, ‘looked for with far
greater pleasure;’ V. i. 54 (ii. 39), nimio plus sapio, ‘I am wiser by
a great deal;' so nimio aequius, Merc. III. ii. 6 3 nimio cz'lz'us, Trin.
ΙΙ. ii. 106; nimio docilior, Bac. I. ii. 56; nimio facilius, Pseud. Ι.
iii. 47; nimio lubentius, Men. V. vi. 15; m'mz'o melius, Pers. I. iii.
31, Truc. II. v, 17: nimio minus, Rud. I. iii. 1, II. v. 3, Truc. II.
v. 3: nimio ocius, Stich. V. V. 53 nimio plus, Bac. I. ii. 143 nimio
pluris, Trin. Ι. i. 123 nimio rectius, Bac. ΙΙ. iii. 80; nimio salius,
Ι. ii. 42, Trin. Π. ii. 30.

(b) Sometimes nimio is connected with a verb which implies
comparison: thus Bac. III. ii. 12, IVt'mt'o praessa! zbzpendz'osum te quam
ingralum dz’cz'cm Poen. I. ii. 90, Bonam ego quam beatam me esse nimio
dz'cz' mavolo. Into the following also the idea of comparison enters:
Truc. IV. i. 6, Quom hoc iam volupe esl, lum hoc nimio magnae mellz'm'ae ·
mila,- that is, ‘ while, on the one hand, this circumstance (viz. that my
gifts have been graciously received by Phronesium) is a source of
pleasure, on the other hand, this other circumstance (viz. that the
gifts of my rival have been scorned) is more sweet by far:y mellz'nz'a
is an ἅπ. λεγ., and is generally understood to mean some sweet drink.
In Men. V. ii. 69, S. Tu negas. ΜΕ. leo hercle vero. M V. lts’zmz‘o
haec inpudenter negas .· the meaning is clearly ‘these denials are more
shameless by far than your previous falsehoods.’ More difficult is the
line atv the commencement of the 6th Scene of the 4th Act of the
Bacchides: Nicobulus enters saying, szio illaec res est magnae
dz'vz‘dz‘ae mihi, Suplerfugesse sic mz‘lu' hodie Chrusalum .· but we may
regard this as intended to be the continuation of a soliloquy com-
menced by Nicobulus before he appeared on the stage, in which,
after having mentioned some annoyance, he goes on, ‘sar more arn
I incensed by the circumstance that Chrysalus‚' &c.

(c) Sometimes the emphasis is increased by the addition of mullo .-
Bac. 1. ii. 42, Video nimio iam mullo plus quam volueram, Vz‘xz‘sse nimio
satius est iam quam πῦσε,- and again in the same play, IV. iv. 20,
AI. Chrusale‚ occidi. C. Fortassis lu auri dempsisti parum. M. Qui,
malum, parum ,ν’ imo vero nimio minus multo parum ,· while we find in
Stich. ΙΙ. ii. 15, le'mz'o zbzperlz'or multo saulo plus quam speras. ln

Most. III. iii. 2 (IV. ii. 2), qum nimia emplac lsln‘ videnlur ,ν’ (sc. aedes),
