common, and is generally equivalent to our ‘to humbug:' thus

slulle cave] Rud. II. ii. 19, Data verba hero sunl; leno abiit scelestus
exsulatum,· Phor. IV. v. 1, Quietus esto, inquam, ego curabo ne quid

11. lisanum adire alicui, ‘to disappoint,’ ‘to frustrate‚' ‘to befool,'
‘to decen-ej ‘to play a trick upon! This phrase was probably
suggested by the play among children of stretching out a hand con-
taining some object as if to present it to a person, and then, when
the victim of the joke is about to take the object, suddenly with—
drawing the hand: thus Aul. II. viii. 8, Ila illis lnpurz's omnibus adii
manum, ‘I disappointed all those filthy fellows—frustrated their
designs ;' Cas. V. ii. 54, Quid nunc? salin lepide adila esl vobe's manus:³
'haven't you been cleverly jockeyed?' Poen. II. 11, Eo pacto avarae
Veneri pulcre adii manuum and v. 16, Quom scibant, Veneri ul adierit
leno manum,· Pers. V. ii. 18, Vt me in tricas com'ecz'slc'! Quomodo de
Persa manus mihi adila est! In the last-quoted example we have
conicere z'n tricas, ‘to entangle in a net;’ and so IV. i. 9, Nunc ego
lenonem ila hodie intricatum dabo, Vt zpsus sese qua se expeditu nesciat.
(See note on Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 45 (41).)

12. Circum. Verbs compounded with circum frequently imply
that a person is ‘led round,' that is, not straight to, but away from,
an object which he wishes to reach, or,'that one person ‘ gets round ’
another, that is, takes him at disadvantage by coming upon him from
behind. Such verbs are frequently used in the general sense of ‘to
deceive,' ‘to cheat:’ thus cz'rcumducere‚ construed with the accu-
sative of the person cheated, to which is generally added the ablative
of the thing out of which he is cheated: thus As. Ι. i. 83, Qua me, qua
uxorem, qua lu servom Sauream Potes, circumduce, au er,· Truc. IV.
iV. 21, Triduom hoc sallem, dum aliquo miles cz'rcumducitum· Pseud. II.
ii. 39, Quasi lu dicas me le velle argento circumducere,· Bac. V. ii. 64,
Quadrz'ngenlzlv Philippis filius me el Chrusalus circumduxerunt. In
Poen. V. v. 7 circumducere and tangere are combined: Sic dedero :
aere militari tetigero lenunculum,· Nactus est hominem, mina quem
argenti circumduceret: other examples of circumducere in Pseud. Ι. ν.
16, Trin. IV. ii. 17. There is a curious anacoluthon with circum—
ducam in Pseud. Ι. v. 1 15, but perhaps the passage is corrupt.
