METRE AN D PROSODY. cix

Age ergo, opserva ,Ι Si peccassis, multam hic retinebo ilico.

So the MSS.; R. omits age, but age ergo may be regarded as a
short, sharp, colloquial expression, and, as such, liable to be curtailed
when enunciated. Poen. IV. ii. 71 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Facile—Fac ergo id facile noscam, ut ille possit noscere,

where fac ergo id must form a Spondce‚ or, as W. seems to think, an
Anapaest. It wilI be observed that quid ergo, age ergo, sac ergo,
are expressions all belonging to the same class.

With regard to quippe, Lind. says, “ Quippe duobus locis Plauti
correptum reperitur, quare de eius correptione dubitatur.'’ The
passages to which he refers are probably—As. Ι. i. 51 (Senar.)‚

Quippe qui mage amico utantur grato et benevolo,

a line which Fleck. brackets as spurious; Epid. V. i. 12 (Troch.
Tetr. Cat.),

Habe bonum animum—Quippe ego quoi libertas in mundo
sila est,

which is referred to in the index of W„ but erroneously, for the line

scans perfectly without altering the natural form of quippe,· and Men.
IV. ii. 17 (Senar.)‚

Quippe qui pro illis loquantur, male quae fecerint.

This is in a Canticum, where W. has picked out a couple of Senarians
from the midst of a number of Bacchiacs and Cretics of varying
dimensions. The distribution is most uncertain.

III. We now come to the consideration of those words, the quantity
of which, as used by Plautus, differs from that observed by later
writers. Considering that quantity depends upon pronunciation, we
might have expected to find a number of words, the pronunciation,
and therefore the quantity, of which had undergone a change during
the 150 years which elapsed from the period when Plautus ssourishcd
to the last days of the Republic. But these are in fact very few.

Acheron, or, according to the earlier orthography‚ Acheruns,

and its derivatives, have the first uniformly short in Lucretius and
virgil: Lucret. Ι. 120,

Et si praeterea lamen esse Acherusia templa,·
111. 37,

Et metus illc foras praeceps Acheruntis agundus,·
Virg. Aen. V11. 312,

Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo‚·
