EXCVRSVS XV.——SLA VE PUNISHMENTS. 2 51

Before quitting this subject we may advert to the circumstance
that a great deal of bad money was in circulation, and hence, when
a sum was paid, not only was it customary to assure the receiver
that the coin was good, but it was submitted to some skilled person
in order that it might be scrutinized and tested3 thus Pers. III. iii. 32,
qumz' sexcenti lzz‘c erunt Probi· numerali, fac sil mulier libera, Atque
huc continuo adduce. D. Iam saxo lu'c erit, lVon, hercle, cuz' nunc hoc
dem spectandum, scz‘0,· and again, IV. vi. 1, Probalz' lzic argenti sunl
sexagz'nla minae.

That sorgeries were common we might infer from the number of
counterfeits, many of them executed with great ingenuity, which are
preserved in the cabinets of collectors. There are the numi plumbei
of Plautus; thus Cas. II. iii. 40, Cui homini hodie peculi numus non
est plumbeus, ‘a fellow whose savings do not amount to a bad
shilling;’ so also Most. IV. ii. 12 (i. 33), Tace sis, faber, qui cudere
soles plumbeos qumos,· and Trin. IV. ii. 120, eine aurum crederem, Cuz‘,
si capitis res siet, numum numquam credam plumbeum? ‘is it likely that
Ι would trust that sellow with gold, whom, were his all at stake‚ Ι
would never trust with a bad shilling?¹

xv—PO'NJSHMENTS INFLICTED UPON SLA VES.

Since the tricks and deceptions which so osten sorm the staple
os the New Comedy are for the most part contrived and executed
by cunning slaves, and since their own masters are not seldom
represented as the victims of these francis, it is not surprising that
the works of the dramatists should abound in words and phrases
applied as taunts to those who had paid the penalty of previous
offences. The expressions employed are curiously varied, by Plautus
especially, and a multitude of terms seem to have been coined for
the purpose.

The common punishment for an ordinary offence was the scourge
(flagrum) applied to the naked back (dorsus s. dorsum—tergus s. ser-
gum) and shoulders (scapulae), osten with such severity as to produce
livid marks, scars, and wheals (cz'calrz'ces—cfferrumenlae)‚ and even to
flay off the skin. The instrument employed was a cat made of
ropes (restes), or strips os ox-hide (lergzuum—lorcz), or bundles of
rods (virgae) in which elm twigs (vu-gae ulmeae) generally took the

place os our own national birch.
