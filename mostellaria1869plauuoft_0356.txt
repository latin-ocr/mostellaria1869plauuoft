giving one absurd etymology (quasi anguiportus, i. e. angusta et curva

indicating the hurry and confusion of the narrator.

V. ii. 6. Docte alque aslule mihi captandum est cum illoc] i. e. ‘ I
must skilfully and craftily lay a trap to ensnare him.’ The construc-
tion mz'hi captandum est cum illoc is remarkable. On the force of
capto see note on IV. ii. 19.

28. Vel hominem iube aedis mancupio poscere] Since homz‘nem in
v. 26 refers to Simo, it might appear harsh to make hominem in this
line refer to Philolaches, and to translate ‘order Philolaches to de-
mancis but we may regard hominem aedis as the double accusative
after poscere, ‘order (your son) to make a demand upon the man
(Simo) for the house! The emendation posci, proposed by Dousa
and adopted by Bothe and Weise, is not sanctioned by any MS„ and
is unnecessary. ln any case the meaning of the passage is ‘make
a demand to have the house legally conveyed under a clear title.’
Plautus here, as in many other places, altogether forgets that a Greek
is speaking who would not employ the technical phrases of Roman
law. Since houses were Res Mancupi, the Dominz'um or absolute right
of property could in ancient times be conveyed to a purchaser by the
ceremony of Mancupatzb only, and hence the phrases mancupio pro-
mittere, dare mancupio, acczpere mancupio, poscere mancupio. There
is a good illustration in Trin. II. iv. 19, lllz'nas quadraginta accepisti
α Callicle, Et ille aedes aps le accepit mancuptb. Slaves also were Res
Mancupi, and when a slave was made over to a new master by
mancupale'o it was held as a guarantee that the seller possessed do-
minium, or absolute right of property in the slave, and if, under any
circumstances, it afterwards turned out that he did not really possess
any such right, then he was bound to reimburse the purchaser.* If
however the slave was sold without mancupatz'o, then the buyer made
the purchase suo periculo, at his own risk, and had no recourse upon
the seller. Thus in the Persa, where the plot turns upon the fraudulent
