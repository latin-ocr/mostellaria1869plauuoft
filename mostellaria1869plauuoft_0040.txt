xiv PROLEGOMENA.

0. The Codex aller of Camerarius, frequently designated, since
the time of Pareus, as the Codex Decurtatus.

On the death of Camerarius this MS. was purchased, along with
the Vetus Codex, and deposited in the Palatine Library, from thence
it was transferred to the Vatican; in 1797 it was carried to Paris,
and in 1815 restored to the Library at Heidelberg, where it now
remains.

It belongs to the twelfth century, and is written on 238 leaves of
parchment in quarto. It originally contained the whole twenty plays,
but the first eight have been torn off, and the last twelve alone remain.
It was executed by various hands, and the writing is by no means
elegant. The division into words is more corrupt than in B; there
is no separation into lines except in a few cases in the Senarians.
The names of the characters are generally inserted both at the corn-
mencement of the scenes and in the changes in the dialogue, and
when omitted a space is usually left blank for their insertion.

The arrangement of the plays is the same as in B.

D. The Codex Vaticanus, numbered 3870.

This has been proved to be the identical MS. brought to Italy in
1429 by Nicolas of Treves from Germany, and delivered to Cardinal
Orsini,* concerning which we have spoken at length above.

It contains, in 308 sheets of parchment, the Amphitruo, Asinaria,
Aulularia, about one-half of the Captivi, and the twelve last plays
entire.

It bears a very close resemblance to C, both in age, shape, writing,
and perverse distribution of the metrical lines, but was written uni-
formly by a single hand, and is somewhat less faulty in the division
of the words.

F. The Codex Lipsiensis, belonging to the Bibliotheca Senatoria.
It belongs to the fourteenth century, is written beautifully on 314 sheets
of parchment in folio, and contains the whole twenty plays. It is
sometimes designated as the Codex Surz'tanus, in consequence of
having, during a portion of the sixteenth century, been in the pos-
session of Hieronymus surita, of Saragossa. It is regarded by R. as
presenting the interpolated text under its best form.

Lastly, we may mention Z, the Edz'le'o Princeps, edited by George
Merula, and printed at Venice in 1472.

[Hence called by R. ‘U1-sinianum.’—En.]
