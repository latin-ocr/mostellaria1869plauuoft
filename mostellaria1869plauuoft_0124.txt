lxxxiv PROLEGOMENA.

in such words as avus, avis, ovis, navis, novus, &c‚ the two syllables
may be contracted into one: thus Bac. IV. vi. 27 (Senar.),

Bene n-aUz—„r agitatur, pulcre haec confertur ναῶ,-
Aul. IV. vii. 3 (Senam),
Fac menlionem cum clv—onculo, mater mea ‚-
Asin. Ι. iii. 65 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚
Aves adsuescunt. Neffise estfizcere sumptum qui quaerit lucrum,

where aves is a monosyllable and necesse est a dissyllable3 Π. ii. 105
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Mox quom Saurean imitabor [effeto ne succenseas,

where caveto is pronounced caulo.
There is a curious passage in the Truculentus, III. ii. 15, where
Stratilax enunciates cavz'llalor as caullator, and Astaphium ridicules

him for his pronunciation,

S. Heus lu, iam postquam z'n urbem crebro commeo,

Dz'cax sum factus: iam sum cavillalor (i. e. caullator) probus.

A. Quid id esl, amabo? Istaecce rz'dz'cularzlz

Cavz'llaliones vz's fortasse dicere.

S. Ila, ul pauxillum dzfferanl a cavz'llulz's (i. e. caululzs or
caulibus, ‘ cabbages’).

The well-known story in Cic. Div. II. 40 serves to illustrate the
popular pronunciation of cave. There was a town in Caria called
Caunus, famous for its figs, which were imported into Italy and
hawked about, the cry used by the vendors being Cauneas! When
Crassus was embarking his troops at Brundusium, previous to his
fatal campaign against the Parthians, he encountered one of these
itinerant dealers‚ and Cicero says it might be urged by the super-
stitious that if he had been warned by the omen he might have
escaped destruction3 Cauneas and Cave ne eas being, it would appear,

identical in pronunciation.
So with the word iuventus,· Amph. Ι. i. 2 (Iamb. Tetr. Acat.),

Iffllult's mores qui sesam, qui hoc noctis solus ambulem,

where we must pronounce Iwenlulz's or Iunlulz's, not, as some would
have, IzZventhlz's; in Cure. Ι. i. 38 (Senar.)‚

lzffilule et pueris lsberzlss ama quid lubet,

summale is a trisyllable‚ ama a monosyllable; in Most. Ι. i. 29
(Senar.),
