in a speech of the elder Cato, quoted also by Aul. Gell. XI. 18,
F ures privatorum furtorum in nervo atque in compedibus aetatem agunt .-
sures publici in auro atque in purpura. In one passage of Plautus
it may signify ‘ a strap’ or ‘ cord :³ Cure. V. iii. 12, Atque ila te nervo
torquebo ett'dem uti catapultae solent,· and here there is probably a pun.
Freund is certainly mistaken when he quotes, as an example of
nervus in the sense of a ‘sinew’ or ‘muscle‚' the line from the
Poenulus V. iv. 99, where Hanno says to his newly-discovered
daughter, Condamus alter alterum ergo in nervom brachialem: he means,
‘let us shut up each other in the prison of our arms‚' or, if we choose
to take nervus to mean ‘a collar‚' it will be, ‘let us encircle each
other’s necks in the collar of our arms.' We find it in the metapho-
rical sense of ‘mental strength! ‘power‚' ‘energy‚’ for the first time
in Eun. II. iii. 21, Sive adeo dzgrna res est ubi tu nervos intendas tuos‚·
but it may be fairly doubted whether there is here any figurative
allusion to an anatomical term.

When a slave had been detected in any serious offence, he was
usually seized upon the spot, and bound hand and soot to prevent
him from running off,* or from taking refuge in some sanctuary‚†
and was frequently kept in prison until his fate was decided. Hand-
cuffs were called manicae or copulae: thus Most. V. i. 17 (ii. 2),
Continuo exsz‘lz‘att's: manicas celet-lter concctz'te,· Capt. III. v. 1, Inscite
huic manicas mastigiae-1 Epid. V. i. 1 1, Quaerllant me, in manibus
gestant copulas sesuncz'as. Fetters for the feet were compedes or pedicae,
and were riveted on: Aul. IV. i. 15, Qui ea curabit apslinebit censione
bubula, ,Nec sua opera rengret umquam in splendorem compede& Capt.
ΙΙΙ. iv. 118, H Verba mihi data csse video. T. Quid cessatis, com-
pedes, Currere ad me, meaque amplecti crura, ul vos custodiam .> Pers.
IV. iv. 24, F erreas tute tt'bz' 1’npz'ngi§ iubeas crassas compedes,· Poen.
ΙΙΙ. i. 10, lVam iste qusdcm gradus subcretus est cribro pollt'narz'o‚ Nisi

* Sceledrus in Mil. Il. vi. 99, Nam iam aliquo aufugiam, et me occultabo
aliquot dits, Dum hae consilescunt turbae atque irae leniunt.

† So Tranio, Most. V. i. 45 (ii. 30), seats himself upon an altar.

1 XVe have manicae again in As. 11. ii. 38. Manicula in Plautus signifies
‘a little hand :’ Rud. IV. iv. 125, Pseud. V. i. 16. By Varro L. L. V. 31, ,
§ ¹3 5, it is explained to mean the cross-bar passing through the stiva of a
plough, which was grasped by the ploughman, ‘ the handle of the plough.’

ξ Cf. Men. Ι. i. 9, ‘Tum compediti anum lima perterrent, Aut lapide excutiunt
clavom, where anum, if this reading is correct, must be equivalent to
anulum, and clavom must be the riveting-bolt.
