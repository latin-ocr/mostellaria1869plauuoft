xcviii PROLEGOMENA.

So the MSS. Guyetus and R. get rid of the difficulty by transposing‚
and have intro modo.

We occasionally find violent transgressions of quantity depending
upon a single example 3 thus Aul. 111. v. 42,

Strophzuriz' adstant, adstant semzaonarii,

where, if we retain the Vulgate‚ we must shorten the two first
syllables in semrzonarz'i. Nothing is more likely than that a cor-
ruption should be found in this passage, where there is a long string
of strange words invented apparently for the nonce. Bothe has pro-
posed a simple emendation—

Slroplzz'arii stant, stant semz'zonarii,

but the word semz'zonarii itself is very doubtful.

[Having thus shown that little or no reliance can be placed on
the above examples as affording evidence that the early dramatists
had no scruple in violating the Rule of Position‚ wherever it suited
the exigencies of their verse to do so, we will proceed to give a few
examples of lines containing one or other of the two classes of anoma-
lies referred to above, p. lxx, and which we have sufficiently indicated
are in our opinion to be scanned by the process called ‘ correpti0n‚'
that is, by slurring over and running together two syllables into one,
rather than by an indiscriminate neglect of the fundamental Law of
position—Eu]

I. Under class 1, consisting chiefly of dissyllables with a short
penultimate, we may instance the following :—

Apud must be pronounced as a monosyllable in Epid. ΙΙΙ. ἰν. 14

(Senar. ‚
) fldemorant &W reges armis arte duellica,

where it will be observed that the two first syllables of duellica suffer
synizesis; again, in Amph. III. ii. 66 (Senar.),

Vt quae affild legionem vola vovi si domum.

Other instances will be found in Capt. I. ii. 90, Cure. II. iii. 66, Most.
I. iii. 141.
Enim is a monosyllable Trin. I. ii. 23 (Senar.),
Namque ἷὴὶῖη tu credo mihi imprudenti obrepserit.

So the MSS.; Camer. has numquam enim, and R. corrects nempe
enim. In Trin. I. iii. 77 (Senar.) we have both enim and nimis as
monosyllables,

Ila saccant—At emm nlmzs longo sermone utimur.
