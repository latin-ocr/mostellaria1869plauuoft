There is no controversy that, in so sar as the text of Plautus and
Terence depends upon MS. authority, there is an immense number
of cases in which elision is altogether neglected‚ that is, in which the
last syllable of a word ending in a long or in a short vowel, in a
diphthong or in the letter m, is not elided before a word beginning
with a vowel, a diphthong‚ or the letter h. Weise refers to sixty·six
“indubitata exempla’' in the Amphitruo alone, and every play will
furnish a large number. But notwithstanding this, not a few of the
editors of Plautus, by changing the order of the words, by inserting
or omitting monosyllables and ejaculations, or, when the more simple
means fail, by bad and arbitrary conjectura] changes, have con-
sidered themselves entitled, at any eost, to force the verses of Plautus
into accordance with the metrica} rules observed by poets whose
compositions are of a character totally different, and who flourished
at a period when the language and the laws of versification had
reached their highest point of cultivation and stringency. The first
who undertook to satisfy the conditions of this sels-imposed law was
Pylades, of Brescia, who considered the simple explanation, “metri
causa‚’' a justification for any change he thought fit to introduce
into the text, and many of his interpolations were adopted by his
sucoessors, and long maintained their ground. Others followed in
the same direction until the work of destruction and reconstruction
seems to have been pushed to its extreme limit by Bothe and Ritschl.

Bentley, while admitting that the licence was frequently resorted
to by Terence, endeavoured to establish a code of rules by which
he supposed it to be defined and limited. These were—‘⁶ In his
autem aliisque similibus tria sunt observanda ; numquam hoc fieri
nisi in verbo monosyllabo ; quod verbum si in vocalem exit, oportet
syllabam esse longam; ictum denique habere in prima syllaba
Anapaesti. Harum vero conditionum ignorantia quot nuper peperit
errores? dum et in polysyllabis verbis, et in syllabis brevibus, et in
aliena sede, posse fieri hoc existimabant.’'

It was soon perceived however by all who took an unprejudiced
view os the subject that the boundaries here marked out were sar
