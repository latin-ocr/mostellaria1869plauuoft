lviii PROLEGOMENA.

According to what we have said above, the scheme of the Troch.
Tetr. Cat. will be as follows :—

 

 

-υ -υ -υ -υ -υ *V
-υψ -υυ -υυ -υυ -uu -υυ l
υυ- υυ- υυ- υυ- υυ- υυ- ι

 

 

 

 

 

Bacchiae Verses.

It is doubtful whether Bacchiae Verses were ever employed by the
Greeks, for the few examples quoted are all susceptible of a different
mode of scansion. They are common in the fragments of the Latin
dramatists, and specimens are to be found in most of the plays of
Plautus.

The species which occurs most frequently is the Bacchiae Tetra-
meter Acatalectic‚ which is found sometimes in a system, sometimes
combined with other species, ancl sometimes interspersed among
verses belonging to other classes, especially Cretics. Bacchiae
Tetrameters Catalectie‚ Trimeters Acat. and Cat., and also Dimeters,
are met with occasionally‚ but they are comparatively rare.

The proper foot is, as the name implies, the Bacchius (υ - -), and
the following is a pure Tetrameter :—

Sibi quisque ruri metit si male emptae.

The Molossus (— — -) is used freely, and is admissible in every
place, frequently in the Ist and 31d‚ less frequently in the 2nd
and 4th.

In 1st‚
Quid minc, vise, specta, tuo usque arbitratu.
In 2nd‚
Recordatzzs maltum et diu cogitavi.
In 3rd,

Ego esse autumo quand& dicta azidz‘etzzv.
In lst and 3rd,

Qudndo hic ntilus est, ei rei ‹irgzimenta dicam.
In 2nd and 4th,

Simul gnarures vds volo esse hanc rem mecam.

In rst, 2nd‚ and 4th, in Amph. II. ii. 22,
F5rtz· sitque ὃᾷΓινηιᾶίο .· id mado si mercedis.
