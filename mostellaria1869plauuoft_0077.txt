ORTHOGRAPHY. xlvii

PROGNATVM [4]‚ SAXSVM [5]‚ PROGENIEM, MAIORVM,
LAVDEM, CREATVM, STIRPEM [7]. From the above ex-
amples it would be impossible to deduce any rule or principle by which
writers were guided as to the insertion or omission of the letter.

As to the omission of final s, we have ANTIOCV, n. 1095,
LECTV‚ n. 1313 bis, PATRONV‚ n. 1033: and in combination
with est, SATIVST, n. 1444, SITVST‚ n. 1297, VOCITATVST
[13]. A few more examples will be found in the index to Mommsen,
but they are by no means numerous.

M‚N.

In derivatives and compounds m had a tendency to pass into n
before the letters c, q, d, t. Thus we have uniformly before c, Clan-
culum, Numubi, Simiam, Princeps, but horumce or horunce; before
d, Tantundem, Tandem, quondam, Quando, qundinae, Clandestinus ‚·
before t, Identidem, διε. Before q, however, there seems to have been
a diversity of practice ‘with regard to the manner of writing the same
words, depending probably upon individual taste: thus in MSS. we
find indifferently umquam, numquam and unquam, nunquam ‚· tamquam,
quamquam and tanquam, quanquam ,· utrimque, utcumque, quicumque and
utrinque, utcunque, quicunque. On the other hand, m is almost always
retained in numquis, quemquam, namque, plerumque, utrumque, quemque,
unumquemque. As a solitary example of m into n before i, we have
quoniam=qu0m iam.

The passages in the grammarians, with regard to m into n, are,
Priscian, p. 555, who, after giving as examples, tandem, tantundem,
identidem, muncubi, adds, “et, ut Plinio placet, nmquis, nunquam :’'
Priscian, p. 945, gives eundem, eandem, quendam, quandam, quorundam,
quarundam, all of which however he adds may be written by simple
composition, i. e. by m: Priscian, p. 958, gives as examples of m
passing into n before c, hunc, hanc, horunce, harunce. Compare
Vel. Long. p. 2236; Beda, pp. 2337, 2344; Martian. Capell. Lib.
ΙΙΙ. p. 55. Marius Victorinus, p. 2462, seems to say that we may
at pleasure unite nonnunquam, nunquam, nunquid, quanquam, unquam,
or substitute m for n.

As an example of the care which it is necessary to exercise in
reading the grammarians, in distinguishing an opinion from a fact,
we may take the following statement of Cornutus ap. Cassiodorum,
p. 2285: “ Tamtus et Quamtus in medio m habere debent: quam
enim et tam est unde quamtitas, quamtus, tamtus, nec quosdam moveat
