foreign, artificial, and known only to the learned, introduced first
by Ennius along with the Greek epic measure, and gradually adopted
in poetical compositions until it became universal in the time of
Augustus. Even if we accept this hypothesis it is clear that we do
not advance one step in our inquiry, for the result is merely this—
Certain syllables are long in the epic poets because they pronounced
them as long, and the same syllables are found short in the dramatic
poets because they pronounced them as short. But the objections
to the hypothesis are so numerous and so obvious, that we feel sur-
prised that it should have been seriously propounded by Hermann
as affording a general solution of the difficulties encountered. In
the first place, if there had been two distinct styles, the differences
between them must have been much more numerous and more
serious than anything we can infer from the prosody os the dra-
matists. Secondly‚ since the supposition that a new pronunciation
was introduced by Ennius must rest upon the belief that such a
change was necessary to give effect to the Dactylic Hexameter and
other metres which he borrowed from the Greeks, it is inconceivable
that the dramatists should, like him, have borrowed all their metres,
or at least all their chief metres, the Iambic and the Trochaic, from
the Greeks and adopted the Greek mode of scanning, while at the
same time they retained a pronunciation which would have destroyed
their rhythmical effect. Lastly, had there been a marked and well·
defined distinction between the popular and what we may call the
epical pronunciation, the dramatists would have adhered steadily to
the former, and not, as is really the case, have resorted to it only
occasionally, while in the great majority of cases they adopted the
latter.

It will be seen that Hermann, in the passage quoted above,
mentions cursorily the “accentum vocabulorum '' as combined with
and, we must suppose, forming part of the “vulgarem pronuntia«
tionem.’' This leads us to say a few words upon the Latin accent,
in which not a few scholars imagine that they have discovered the
true key to the metrical anomalies in the dramatists. Foremost
among these is Lindemann, who, in an elaborate treatise, De
Prosodz'a Plauti, prefixed to his very useful edition of the Captivi,
Miles, and Trinummus, after adopting in a somewhat modified
shape the views of Hermann with regard to a change in the popular
pronunciation which, if not absolutely introduced by Ennius, was by
him first fully established, thus goes on—“ Igitur Graeci sermonis
