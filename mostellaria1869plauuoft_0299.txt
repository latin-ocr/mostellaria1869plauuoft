NOTES. 1. ii. 26—47. 119

i. e. ‘let in water through the roof;' Apul. Met. X. 236, Tum de
summo montis cacumine per quandam latentem fistulam in excelsum
prorumpit vino crocus diluta, sparsimque defluens pascenlis circa capellas
odoro perpluit imbre, i. e. ‘ wets them through‚’ transitively, as in
Most. Ι. iii. 8.

31. siquid numo sarciri potest] So in the parallel v. 68 (62), non
videor milti Sarcire posse aedes meas.

32. Vsque mantant] ‘they keep putting off, procrastinating.’
Manto is a frequentative from maneo. The word occurs again in
Poen. Ι. ii. 52, herus nos apud aedem Veneris mantal, i. e. ‘is waiting
for us ;' and Pseud. I. iii. 49, aliquot hos dies manta modo, i. e.
‘only wait for a few days ;’ and in the same scene, 1223. vah,
manta, ‘pooh, stop? and again, Rud. II. iv. 26 ; it is quoted from
Caecilius by Fest. s. v. mantare, p. 133, ed. Miill.; and by Non.
s.v. mantal, p. 505. There is another frequentative form mansilo,
which appears in the Post-Augustan writers.

38. Extollunt, parant sedulo in firmitatem, Vt et in usum boni el
in speciem populo Sz'nt; but in v. 60, ego sum in usu Faclus nimio
nequion· here W reads usum, but is wrong. For this use of in with
the accusative see note on i. 31, and compare Amph. I. i. 25, nu-
mero mihi in mentem fuit. Ecquid te pudet? S. Omnia quae lu vis.
C. Vbi in lustra zacuz'sli. S. Egone in lustra! Trin. ΙΙΙ. iii. 38,
Is homo exornelur graphice in peregrinum modum ,· Rud. Ι. iV. 1, Quid
mihi melius est, quid magis in rem est quam, 8103 IV. ii. 31, Mag-
nas res hic agito in mentem instruere ‚· Pseud. I. i. 126, edico . . .
In hunc diem a me ul caveant ; v. 121, De istac re in oculum utrumvis
conquz‘escito. C. Oculum ulrum, anne in aurem ,ν’ T. At hoc pervolgatum
est minus.

47. Igilur lum] ‘thereafter;’ and again III. i. 159 (156). (In
the latter of these the Vulg. gives Igitur dum, in opposition to all the
MSS.) VVhatever may be the etymology of zgrz'tur—and nothing can
be more unsatisfactory than the one proposed by Hand, in which
scholars seem, for the most part, to have acquiesced-it is certain

⁰ that in the older forms of the language igilur uniformly signifies
‘ then' or ‘ thereafter,’ and denotes that an event follows after another
previously mentioned, either simply in time or both in time and as a
result; the use of 1gilur, denoting a logical result, belongs to a late
period. We cannot have a better example than the Law of the
XII. Tables quoted by Porph. on Hor. S. I. ix. 76, and cleverly
restored by Carrio and Dirksen‚ Si. in. ius. vocal. ni. z't. antestator. igilur.
