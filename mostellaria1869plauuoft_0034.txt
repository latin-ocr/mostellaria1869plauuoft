viii PROLEGOMENA.

a very pale brown, while the ink of others is unusually black. Again,
in the same play, portions of several pages have been left blank, and
as these blanks do not indicate any gap in the sense, and occur be-
fore a change in the hand, it seems reasonable to infer that different
scribes had different portions of the play allotted to them, without
any nice calculation as to the accurate union of the portions.

The MS. has been ruled throughout, generally with some blunt-
pointed instrument which marked the vellum without ruffling the
surface. The lines however are in many cases irregular, being
closer to each other in some parts of the same page than in others,
while the number of lines in different pages varies much, the general
number however contained in one page being fifty-one or fifty-two.
In some cases, e. g. in portioris of the Rudens, the pages are written
in double columns. Irregular as is the execution of the work, the
writing is notwithstanding legible throughout, the contractions are
few and for the most part simple.

As to the division of the words, the statement of Ritschl, “Verborum
distinctio aut nulla est aut prava,'’ is not borne out, at least as far as
the Mostellaria is concerned, as in this play the words are for the
most part correctly divided in the MS. There is no division into
acts; but in some plays the different scenes are distinguished, a space
being left at the end of each in which are inserted in red ink the
names of the persons who take part in the following scene. In like
manner, the changes of person in the dialogue are carefully indicated
by the insertion of the speaker's name in red ink, either at the be-
ginning of the line or in a space left for the purpose in the middle
of the line as the case may be. This however does not apply to all
the plays, in some of which great irregularity prevails. In the Persa,
for example, although spaces have been left marking' the divisions
of the scenes, the names of the characters have been inserted in five
or six cases only, while, although spaces are left to indicate the
transition from one speaker to another in the dialogue, the names
have in no case been inserted. In all probability the names of the
characters were added after the plays were transcribed, and by a
different hand ; a view which derives confirmation from the fact that
while in some plays they are written in red ink, in others, e. g. the
Curculio, Casina, Epidicus, in black, which in some cases has been
written or painted over with red3 in some cases, e. g. conspicuously
in the Persa, the blanks have never been filled up at all, and while
Roman characters are generally employed in some plays, Greek
characters have been made use of in others.
