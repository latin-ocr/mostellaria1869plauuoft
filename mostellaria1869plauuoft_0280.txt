100 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

decumam partem Herculi* polluceam. We find also the participle in
Rud. ΙΙ. iv. 11, lVon ego sum pollucta pago. Potin’ ul me apstineas
manum.) which must mean, ‘Hands off! Ι am no tit bit for the
bumpkins of the parish‚’ i. e. ‘I am meat for your masters.' The
application of this word in Curc. I. iii. 37, T un’ meam Venerem vitupe-
ras ,ν’ Quod quidem mihi polluctus virgis servos sermonem serat! which
must signify ‘a slave who has been entertained with a liberal allow-
auce of stripes :’ sor the verb pollucere signifying ‘to offer in sacrifice‚'
and the custom being to present the most choice objects of each
kind to the gods, the derivatives of pollucere frequently convey the
notion of sumptuousness, magnificence‚ unsparing liberality3 thus
we find in Maerob. S. II. 13, pollucz'bz'lz‘s cena in the sense of a
sumptuous banquet‚ and in the passage before us opsonale pollucibiliter
mean, ‘make your market without stinting yourself.’ So also we
have seen above, in the passage quoted from Cassius Hemina,
polluctum used in reference to a banquet prepared in honour of the
gods without regard to price; and Macrob. S. ΙΙ. 12 mentions
specially a polluclum Herculis ,· in the Rud. V. iii. 63 we read,
«S'peclalores, vos quoque ad cenam vocem, Μ’ dalurus nil sim, neque sil
qm'cquam pollucti domi, i. e. ‘anything dainty;' and finally, in Stich.
V. iv. 6, lzz'nc quidem Hodie polluctura, praeter nos, iam dabitur nemini,
i. e. ‘good cheer.’ The modification in meaning which pollucere and
its derivatives assumed in the later writers may be seen by referring
to the Lexicons. The etymology is uncertain, but it has been
conjectured with some plausibility that it is connected with porricae'o,
which also is a sacrificial word. See Priscian IX. p. 874, and
quotation from the Colax of Naevius. See also Bentley’s Terence,
ed. Volbehr, p. xxvi.

24. quom peregre hinc iil] The young scholar will observe that
peregre signifies, 1. ‘to’ a foreign land; 2. ‘from’ a foreign land;
3. ‘in' a foreign land; according to the verb with which it is con-
structed. 1. The words in our text yield an example of the first,
and so abiit peregre in IV. ii. 41 (iii. 18). 2. In II. i. 6, herus
advenit peregre, periit Tranio ,· and so peregre advenit, advem'sse, adveni
advenis, venit. venisse, in II. i. 27, III. i. 83 (79), ΙΙΙ. ii. 54, 1 18 (116),
IV. iii. (iv.) 12, V. ii. (iii.) 2, V. ii. (iii.) 8. 3. In Pers. Ι. i. 30,
T. Basilice agilo eleullzerz‘a. S. Quid z'am Ρ Τ. Quia herus peregre
cst. S. Ain lu, peregre eis So peregre ablegavil, Cas. Prol. 62;
p. prrficlus esl. Trin. I. ii. 112; p. gcslandus clupeus, T rin. ΙΙ. ἰν. ι95;
