ORTHOGRAPHY. xlv

inscription found at Pompeii, and ascribed by Mommsen to the age
of Augustus.

ALIVD, twice in 19, once in 203
ALIVT, never.

APVD, 1, 3, 10, 11 quater, 12 sexies, 17, 19 sexies, 20 ;

APVT, three times in 20, the last of the series, belonging to B.C. 45.

HAVD, no example in 1-20, but one in n. 1306. For HAV,
see above.

ID, nom. and. acc„ 1-20, about thirty-six times ;
IT, never.

ILLVD, no example.
ISTVD, no example.

QVOD, nom and acc., 1-20, upwards of ninety times;
QVOT, never3

QVOD, conj„ 1—20‚ about sixteen times.

QVID, nom. and acc., 1-20, about twenty-eight times;
QVIT, never.

Sed, the conjunction‚ is not found in 1-20; it occurs on one of
the curious brazen “sortes‚'’ n. 1442, and a reference is made in
the index to Sed, in n. 1220 ; but there must be some mistake in the
number, for Sed is certainly not found in that inscription*

Under these circumstances there would appear to be no pretext

for departing from the ordinary orthography of any one of the ten
words in question.

D Paragogicum.

It is well known that in the earlier stages of the Latin language
we find many words ending with a d, which was entirely dropped
at a later period. Grammarians have given to the letter thus

* To prevent mistakes we must call the attention of the young scholar
to the fact that in the older forms of the language he will find two words,
Sed, distinct from the conjunction and from each other. 1. Sed, which is
equivalent to Sine, and which enters into some ancient legal forms; the ex-
pression se fraude being introduced to declare that the doer of certain acts,
performed ministerially, should be relieved from responsibility. Thus, in frag-
ment of the Laws of the XII. Tables, preserved by Aul. Gell. XX. 1, ξ 49,
“ Tertiis . Nundinis . Partis . Secanto . Si . Plus . Minus . Ve . secuerunt .
Se. Fraude. Esto; ·’' and in the Lex Servilia (12), “ Eam. Pequniarn .
Eis. Se. F rude Solvito; ” and again in the same Law,“1d.Q1aestor .

..Sed Fraude . Sua. Extra. Ordinem. Dato. Solvitoque. ” See
Paul. Diac. s. v. p. 336, ed. Miill. 2. Sed, the accusative of Sui, with
what is called the D paragogicum. See next section.
