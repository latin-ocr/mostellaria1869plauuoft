xxx PROLEGOMEN A.

Dz‘plztlzongs.

Considerable uncertainty prevailed in the use of diphthongs.
Originally ai seems to have been used in preference to ae. Thus,
GNAIVOD, AIDILIS [l]‚ AIDILES, AIDILIS, AIDE(M) [3]‚
QVAIRATIS [5]‚ ·QVAIS(ter) [6], AID. CVR. [7]‚ AEDEM,
AIQVOM, TABELAI DATAI (nom.) [10]‚ So PRAIDAD, n. 63,
64; QVAISTORES, n. 181, 185 (also QVEISTORES, n. 183);
AIRE, n. 181. So 1n many proper names, especially in AIMILIVS

Again, we have οι used for oe: as FOIDERATEI [10]‚ and
FOIDERE [20]

Less frequent is the use of a simple vowel for a diphthong‚ as
FORTVNE, n. 64; FRVDE [12], which may be an accidental
blunder‚ since we have FRAVDE a few lines lower down in the
same inscription.

EIS for IS z‘n Datives and Ablalz'ves Plural qf the
Fz'rsl and Second Declensz'ons.

The practice in this case was similar to what took place in the use
of ei for long i. In all probability the longer form was universal at first,
prevailed for a considerable time, and by degrees fell altogether into
disuse. It maintained its ground however more firmly and for a
longer period than ei. All the examples in the earliest inscriptions
uniformly exhibit eis. Thus FACTEI(S) [4]‚ MIEIS [7]‚ EEIS
three times, and VOBEIS [10]‚ PROXSVMEIS [11 ler], TABO·
LEIS [11 ὂιζς], EIS [11]. When we come down to 12 we find the first
indications of uncertainty; although the examples of ezir are nume-
rous, we find ROSTREIS and ROSTRIS, AESTVMANDEIS and
AESTVMANDIS, LEGVNDEIS and LEGVNDIS, and the com-
bination TABOLEIS PVPLICIS, although TABOLEIS POPLI-
CEIS occurs also. We have three examples of PRIMIS in 12,
in 16 three examples of PRIMEIS, and, generally speaking, down to
20, and even later, the form eis will be found greatly to preponderate‚
so that we may without scruple employ it in the text of Plautus*

Plural Cases qs llze T lzz'rd Declension in EIS, ES, IS.

It is well known that nominatives‚ and especially accusatives

* [It would appear from this expression that the author had contem-
plated employing in his text the form eis in the cases specified above. It
will be seen from the Preface on vhat grounds I have thought it advisable
to retain the more familiar orthography.-E1›.]
