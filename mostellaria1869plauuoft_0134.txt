Trapezz'la. Goeller, Lindemann, and Ritschl would allow the
second syllable in T rapezz'la to be short, on the authority of Trin. II.
iv. 23 (Senar.),

T rapezz'tae mille drachumarum Olympicum,

in which they suppose the first foot to be an Anapaest. B has
drachumarum,· C, D, E, drahcumarum; but A has the common
form drachmarum. But although the first syllable in drachma must
be long, it by no means follows that the first syllable in drachuma
is also long; on the contrary, we should be justified in asserting
that it must be short, for the Greek δραχμή is naturally short, and
accordingly being followed by the aspirated mute χ and the liquid μ
appears as short in Aristop. Plut.‚ 884,

Τὸν δακτύλιον τονδί παρ’ Εὐδάμου δρῖἱχμῆς.

Hence all difficulty as to the scansion of the above line vanishes, and
it is unnecessary to have recourse to the expedient of pronouncing
mille as a monosyllable. In other passages of Plautus trapezita has
uniformly its proper quantity, e. g. Asin. II. iv. 32, Capt. I. ii. 90,
II. iii. 89, Cure. II. iii. 62, 66, ΙΙΙ. 36, 50, IV. iv. 3, V. ii. 20,
iii. 34, 43, Pseud. Π. iv. 67.

Philippus, th'lz'ppeus, th'lzppz'cus. The case of these words is
peculiar‚ and demands special notice. They occur upwards of
thirty times in Plautus m'th reference to gold coin, and in every
instance, except perhaps one, to be noticed below, the two first
⁴syllables are to be pronounced as one-Phlzppus, Phlz'ppeus. (Phi-
lzppeus however does not occur in nominative sing.) This cannot
be accidental‚ but must have resulted from the ordinary pronun-
ciation of the word, for the form Philippus would be quite as ser-
viceable in an Iambic or Trochaic line as Phlzppus. Again, th'lz'ppezcs,
Philippeo, Philippei, &c., seem sometimes pronounced as trisyllables,
Phlippefzs, &c.‚ but more frequently as dissyllables, Phlippm, &c.,
never as tetrasyllables‚ Phllippfflcs. th'lz‘ppz'cum occurs once only,
and must be pronounced Phlz'ppz'cum. Thus Poen. Ι. iii. 6 (Senar.),

Trecentos thffbpos Collubz'sco villico,-
