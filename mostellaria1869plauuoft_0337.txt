NOTES. III. i. 43—81. 155

semper hic est usque a mani ad vesperum Quasi flagitator astat usque ad
ostium ,· and for flagitium, Epid. ΙΙΙ. iv. 77, F. Fides non reddis ,ν’
P. Neque fides, neque tibias. Propera zgrz'turfugere hinc, si te Di amant.
F. Abiero. Flagitzo cum maiore post reddes tamen. The same practice
is alluded to in L ii. 15, where a debtor exclaims, Quin edepol egomet
clamore defetzgrom differo& and Curc. V. iii. 5, Postquam nihil fit,
clamore bominem posc0,· and in a more general sense Truc. IV. ii. 46,
Iam hercle ego tibi, illecebra, ludos faciam clamore in via Quae advorsum
legem accepisti a plurimis pecuniam.

62. te extentatum] ‘to exhaust yourself with bawling‚' i. e. ‘to
stretch your lungs till they crack.’ The verb extento, a frequentative
from extendo, occurs again in Bac, IV. ii. 1, Quid istuc?v quae istaec est
pulsatio? Quae te mala crux agitat ,ν’ ad istunc qui modum Alieno vires
tuas extentes ostio ,Ρ and in Lucr. III. 489, where he is describing a
man seized with a fit, Concidit et spumas agn, ingemit et tremit artus,
Deszpit, extentat nervos, torquetur, anhelat ‚⁰ but it is not found in any
other Latin author till we come down to Ammianus Marcellinus.

63. Ne γρυ quidem] γρυ, as will be seen from the various readings,
is a conjecture of Acidalius. The MSS. have nec erit quidem, which
is quite unintelligible. There are several passages in Plautus where
Greek words are brought in, and these, as might be expected, appear
in most cases in a very corrupt form in the MSS. Below‚ in IV, iii.
46, Μὰ τόν Ἀπόλλω is written correctly in Latin characters in the
Palimpsest; in Bac. V. ii. 43, Hermann has probably hit the truth
when he substitutes Ναὶ γάρ sor the necar of the Palatine MSS„
which appears in interpolated MSS. and the Vulgate as necas .· so in
Trin. II. iv. 17 we cannot doubt that oechete or oe clze te of the MSS.
has been correctly interpreted by οἴχεται, and that in Poen. Ι. i. 9
Lvraeline stands for λῆροι λῆροι ; so in Cas. ΙΙΙ, vi. 9, 10, the reading
πράγματά μοι παρέχεις, μέγα κακὸν, Ὠ Ζεῦ, rests upon satisfactory traces;
in Truc. V. 36 φλυαρεῖν may be accepted, but in Pseud. II. iv. 22 the
χάριν τούτῳ ποιῶ Of Scaliger, the χάριν οἰωνὸν ποιῶ Of Camerarius, the
χαῖρε, οἰωνὸν ποιῶ Of Lambinus, and the χαίρειν Χαρῖνον volo Of Acida-
lius, although all ingenious, are mere guesses‚ for the characters in
the MSS. are so obscure that they cannot be deciphered with any
approach to certainty.

81. Ne inconciliare quid nos porro postules] The word inconciliare
is found three or four times in Plautus, but is not found in the extant
writings of any other classieal author. Looking to the etymology,
since conciliare signifies ‘to join together‚' ‘to bring into close

union,’ and hence ‘to act the part of a go-betwcen or brokcr' in
