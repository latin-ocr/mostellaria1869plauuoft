ORTHOGRAPHY. xxxi

plural of masculine and feminine nouns of the third declension,
have the terminations in ez's and z's as well as ες.

Thus we have the nominatives CEIVEIS in 12, FINEIS twice
in 13, and IOVDICIS in 12, FINIS in 13 ; the accusatives
FINEIS [13 bzlr, 18 ᾳτιι)ιᾳιιιὲ,ς], GENVATEIS [13], OMNEIS [13‚
16 bz’s], CALLEIS [14], DECEMBREIS [16 sexz‘es]‚ CIVEIS [18
bz’s], ALPEIS [19 bz's]‚ and LITIS [12]‚ SEXTILIS [13], OMNIS
[12 ter], OCTOBRIS [14]‚ MVNICIPIS [20 bis] Itis reasonable
to suppose that ez's was the original form, and that the two forms in es
and z's arose from some dropping out one vowel and some the other.

In some of the oldest MSS. of the Latin classics‚ the Medicean
Virgil for example, the form in is, especially in accusatives, is much
more common than that in es, although the latter is by no means ex-
cluded. Hence a conclusion has been drawn that the form in is is the
more ancient, and therefore ought to be introduced in all cases into
the text of Plautus in preference to es, at all events in accusatives.

But setting aside the consideration that the practice of the fifth
century after Christ cannot be accepted as any evidence of the
practice of the second or third century before Christ, we can prove
that the termination in es was in use from the earliest period to
which our knowledge extends, and appears even before eis: thus
we have OPSIDES, acc. [1]; VIRTVTES, acc. [5]; VIRTVTES,
acc. [7]; HOMINES, nom, MVLIERES, nom. [10]; RE-
CVPERATORES, acc. [11]; while we have no trace of is in the
nominative or accusative until we come down to 11 and 12; we
have given all the examples of t's which are to be found in 12-20,
amounting to eight* in all, while the termination es recurs much
more frequently.

Curiously enough, in the Polla inscription,† although extending
to a few lines only, we have examples of all the three forms: PON-
TEIS OMNEIS, HOMINES, FORVM AEDISQVE POPLICAS,
all in the accusative, and PAASTORES in the nominative.

Priscian (p. 553) tells us, on the authority of Pliny, that some
states of Italy, especially the Umbrians and the Etruscans, had not

the vowel ξ, but employed the vowel ξι instead; and this assertion

the Duilian Column four more, making thirteen in all—Eu]
