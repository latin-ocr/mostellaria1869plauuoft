276 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

‘ is 1 do not send you about your business after I have made you cut
a miserable figure! In Pseud. Ι. iii. 135 we have the phrase, to be
noticed again below, operam ludere, ‘to lose one's labour,' In pertusum
ingerimus dicta dolium, operam ludimus ‚· and this in Rud. IV. i. 9
appears under the form, Nam nunc el operam ludos facil * el reita, ‘ he
is losing his labour and spoiling his nets.'

we must carefully distinguish the phrase ludos facere aliquem, ‘to
make a show of a person,’ from ludos facere alz'cuz',† which properly
signifies ‘to exhibit games in honour of one deceased,’ and is used
by Plautus in the ironical sense, ‘to exhibit a spectacle for the
amusement of others in honour of a living man, who is as powerless
in the hands of the exhibitors as if he were a corpse on the funeral
pyre.' The origin of the expression is clearly indicated in Most. ΙΙ.
i. 80, Ludos ego hodie vivo praesenti lzz'c sem' F acsam, quod credo mortuo
numquam fore, ‘I will exhibit games in honour of this old gentleman
alive and looking on—a distinction which, I fancy, will never bc
accorded to him when dead;' so Cas. IV. i. 1, Nec pol ego Nemeae
credo, neque ego Olumpz'ae‚ lVeque usquam ludos lam festivos ficri, Quam
lzl'c inlus fiunt ludi ludificabiles Seni nostro, el noslro Olumpz'om‘ vz'llz'c0,·
and so Truc. IV. ii. 46, where Dinarchus exclaims, Iam hercle ego tibi,
inlecebra, ludos fita-iam, clamore in via, he does not mean, ‘ I will make
game of you,' or ‘I will make a fool of you,’ but says ironically, ‘I
will make an exhibition in honour of you by shouting out your name
in the public street,’ referring to the pipulum, which is sully explained
in the note on Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 59 (55).

We find the following couplet twice in Plautus, Merc. ΙΙ. i. 1 and
Rud. III. i. 1, lllz'rz'r modis Di ludos faciunt hominibus, Mz‘rz'sque
exempltlr somnia in somnis danunt. We must not suppose that the
speaker intends to say, ‘the Gods make sport of men,’ that is,
‘besool or deceive or hold them up to 1·idicule,' which would by no
means accord with the belief then prevalent with regard to dreams,
but, ‘after a marvellous sashion do the Gods exhibit spectacles for
men,' that is, ‘sor the interest and instruction of men, by warning
thern of coming events by strange appearances exhibited to them in
dreams.' Observe that the forms used by Plautus are invariably
ludos facere aliquem or ludos facere alicui, never ludum, the phrases
being derived from ludi in the sense of Public Spectacles ; the only

²³² Here the MSS. have ludos dat, but Priscian in quoting the passage
gives ludos flacit.

† Ritschl, Parcrg. Ptaut. l. p. 427—30, seems to regard them as sy-
nonymous.
