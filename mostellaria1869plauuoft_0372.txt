perhaps we ought in all such cases to resolve eliam into its component
parts and write them separately, as el iam. It must be borne in mind
that the force of ‘even now' is variously modified according to the
general sense of the passages into which these words enter. Thus,

1. ‘Even now’ signifies ‘at this present time‚’ ‘ directly,' ‘without
delay,’ in such phrases as ‘the battle is even now going on,’ ‘I must

2. With a negative ‘even now' may signisy ‘yet‚’ ‘ as yet,’ ‘ up to
this time‚' in such phrases as ‘even now the boy cannot write‚’ ‘ even
now 1 have never employed him in such work.’

3. The expression ‘is the man even now awakeP' may imply ‘is
the man, having been for some time awake‚ still awake? and hence it
appears that ‘even now’ may indicate that things are continuing with-
out interruption in the same state in which they have been sor some
time previously. So, when we say ‘he is even now beating his
slave,’ or ‘he is even now mocking me,' these words may indicate
that the person spoken of is continuing an action previously com-
