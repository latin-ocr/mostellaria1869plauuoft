1 6 2 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

speaking offar, says, Primus antiquis Latio cibus, magno argumento
in adoreae donis, sicuti diximus ,· pulle autem non pane vixisse longo
tempore Romanos manfistum, quoniam et pulmentaria hodieque dicuntur
. . . . Et hodie sacra prisca atque natalium pulte fritilla conficiuntur,
videnturque tam puls ignota Graeciae fuisse quam Italiae polenta.
Respect for a great name must not allow us to hesitate in rejecting
the explanation of Scaliger, who would make the pultzphagus cspifex
barbarus a Carthaginian artificer‚ because mention is frequently made
in the Roman writers of carpentry work executed by the Cartha-
ginians. See notes on Varr. R. R. III. 7.

IV. i. 5. Exercent sese ad cursuram] i. e. ‘they train themselves in
running.’ Cf. Stich. II. i. 34, Simulque ad cursuram meditabor me
ad ludos Olympiam see also As. ΙΙ. ii. 61, Bac. Ι. i. 34, Merc. I. 10,
Trin. IV. ii. 164, iii. 9.

17. Plagzgrerulus and Plagigcr are ἅπ. My„ each being found once
in Plautus. The latter occurs Pseud. I. ii. 20, Huc adhibete aures,
quae ego loquar, plagzgrera genera hominum. Plagzpatida, which also
is a vox Plautina, occurs twice: above, II. i. 9, Vbi sunt isti plagi-
patidae, ferritribaces viri,· and again, Capt. III. i. 12, Nil morantur
iam Laconas, imi supselli viros, Plagzpatidas, quibus sunt verba sine
penu et pecunia.

22. die crastini] i. e. die crastino, cras. Aulus Gellius, X. 24,
states that the forms die quarti, quinti, noni, pristini (for pridie),
crastini, proximi, and the like were employed exclusively by Cicero
and his predecessors instead of die quart0, quinto, nono, pristina, &c.,
which afterwards came into general use, and that the older combi-
nation was frequently used by Augustus in his letters. He adds that
the ancients said indifferently die quarti or quarte, quinti or quinte, the
words die quarti, &c., being pronounced as one, and regarded as an
adverb with the second syllable short. He quotes from the ,Mimiambi
of Cn. Matius, whom he characterises as ‘impense doctus,’ two lines
to prove that die quarto was considered by him equivalent to nudius
quartus, and arrives at the conclusion that die quarto properly refers
to past time, and die quarti or quarte to future time. See also
Macrob. S. Ι. 4. In Plautus we find, Men. V. ix. 94, MEs. Vis con-
clamari auctionem sore? Quodie? ME. Die septimi. MES. Auctio fiet
Menaechmi mane sane septimi: and Pers. ΙΙ. iii. 7, Nam herus meus me
Eretriam misit, domitos boves uti sibi mercarer Dedit argentum: nam
ibi mercatum dixit esse die septimi.

24. Postremo] It is a little difficult to catch the precise force of
this word in dialogue; here it seems to be equivalcnt to ‘ Well, well,
