NOTES. Ι. i. 63, 64. 111

calfi’* Upon the whole, although Ι feel no confidence, I am inclined
to consider that caedite is here equivalent to concidite, and is used
with reference to effercite-farcio signifying properly to stuff a sausage,
‘ eat, stuff yourselves out like sausages, chop up the good things.'

63. ire . . . parare] i. e. ‘to go to the Piraeus for the purpose of
procuring.' This use of the infinitive to denote a purpose or design,
especially after a verb of motion, is extremely rare in the writers of
the Augustan age, but is by no means uneommon in Plautus, as will
appear from the following examples: thus, Amph. Ι. i. 106, qunc
pergam heri imperium exsequi, et me domum capessere ,· Bac. II. iii. 120,
Senex in Ephesum ibit aurum arcessere ,· IV. iii. 18, Parasitus
modo veneral aurum petere ‚· IV. viii. 59, Illa autem in arcem
abivit aedem visere lllz'nervae ,· Cure. I. iii. 50, Msnume .· nam para-
situm misi nudius quartus Cariam Petere argentum ,· Rud. Ι. ii. 6,
Nunc huc ad Veneris sanum venio visere ,· iv. 4, Omnia iam circum-
cursavi atque omnibus in latebris perreptavi Quaerere conservam voce,
oculis, auribus, ut pervestzgarem ‚· Truc. V. 1, Eo milii amare (a very
strange phrase); Trin. IV. iii. 6, Ecce hominem te, Stasime, nihili!
satin in thermopolio Condalium es oblitus, postquam thermopotasti gut-
turem! Recipe te, et recurre petere, re recenti ,· Pseud. ΙΙ. ii. 47,
Reddere lzoc non perdere herus me misit. IV. V. 4, quoted by W,
is not an example according to the common reading. Nor do I

think that Amph. I. i. 106, quoted above, falls under this head.
See example of constructions of pergo.

64. piscatum] Piscatus must here signify ‘a dish of fish.’ So
below, III. ii. 41, piscatu probo, ‘excellent fish;' and in Cic. de Fin.
ΙΙ. 8, piscatu, aucupio, venatione, signify ‘the produce of fishing,
fowling, and the chase.’ The meaning varies in different passages:
in Bac. Ι. i. 69, bonus piscatus is ‘a good take or haul of fish;' and
so Rud. IV. ii. 6, piscatu novo me uberi compotivit (sc. Neptunus),
while in the next line piscatus seems to be the ‘act of fishing‚'
llliroque modo atque incredibili lzic piscatus mihi Lepide evenit, i. e. ‘ this
fishing of mine,’ but it may mean here also, ‘this haul of fish;’ in
Rud. IV. i. 7, abiit piscatum ad mare must‘ mean, ‘he went away
a-fishing to the sea;' and so it is used by Plin. H. N. VIII. 16, § 17,
omnium quos venatus aucupia piscatusque alebant. Piscatus, like
gemitus, senatus, sumptus, tumultus, and many others, belonged also
to the second declension in the earlier form of the language, and
Non. s. v. piscati, p. 488, quotes from Pomponius omne piscati genus,

* The translation given in the English ed., ‘chew your mast‚‘ ‘exercise
your grinders‚' is vague and quite wide of For.'s meaning.
