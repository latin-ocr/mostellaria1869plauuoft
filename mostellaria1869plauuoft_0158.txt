cxii PROLEGOMENA.

Ex unoquoque eorum excutiam crepitum polentarz'um

where the word must be scanned po'lenlarz'um, although pblem‘a has
the first short in Ovid and Persius. But here we may observe that
polcnlarz'us is a word apparently coined by Plautus himself, and found
in this passage only, nor is it used by any other author until we
come down to Apuleius, and there is no reason why we should not
connect it with the kindred pollen. In so far as the unsavoury joke
is concerned, the readers of Rabelais will at once perceive that it
will lose nothing of its force if we derive the word directly from
pollen, and not through the medium of polenla.

Suspicio, the substantive, with the second long, is frequently quoted
as an example of an anomalous quantity, because suspicio, the verb,
has the second short. But suspicio, the noun, occurs frequently in
Plautus and Terence, and has the second syllable uniformly long;
it has the same syllable long in Martial and the later poets; and, as
far as I know, no example of this word, with the second short, can
be quoted from any classical writer.

So also Rzzbzdus (from rubeae) occurs twice, Cas. I. v. 2, Stich. I. iii.
77 ; coquinalum (from coquinus), Aul. III. i. 3, Pseud. III. ii. 645 and
coquinare, v. 853 but these words occur in verse in Plautus only,
and therefore we cannot compare his practice with that of other
poets. Moreover, with regard to the first, the derivation of rzibzklus
from rubeo is by no means certain; and with regard to the second,
we might be led to believe, from a passage in Paul. Diae. (p. 61,
ed. Mun), that the form used by Plautus was coquz'tare, and not

co uznare.
qProtervus and its derivatives have the first syllable short in the

Augustan writers, as in the Horatian Choriambic,

Vrz'l grata protervz'las,
and the Ovidian pentameter,

Damnaret nalisacla praterea paler,
while in Plautus, Bac. IV. iii. 1 (Troch. Tetr. Acat.),
petulans protervo iracundo animo, indomito, z'ncogilaezlo,
and Amph. II. ii. 207 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),
Audacem esse, el confidenter pro se el pro'lerve loqui,

protervo and proterve must have the first long. When however we
remember the uncertainty and inconsistency which prevails in the best
writers as to the quantity of the first syllable of words compounded
with pro, we need feel no surprise with regard to protervus.
