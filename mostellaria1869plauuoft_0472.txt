284 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

neque mulieres Romanae per Herculem deiurant, neque viri per
Castorem. Sed cur illae non iuraverint Herculem, obscurum non
est. Nam Herculaneo sacrificio abstinent. Cur autem viri Castorem
iurantes non appellaverint, non facile dictu est. Nusquam igitur
scriptum invenire est apud idoneos quidem scriptores, aut mehercule
feminam dicere, aut mecastor virum. Aedepol autem, quod iusiurandum
per Pollucem est, et viro et feminae commune est. Sed M. Varro
asseverat antiquissimos viros neque per Castorem neque per Pollucem
deiurare solitos3 sed id iusiurandum fuisse tantum feminarum ex
Initiis Eleusiniis acceptum: paulatim tamen, inscitia antiquitatis,
viros dicere aedepol cepisse; factumque esse ita dicendi morem: sed
mecastor a viro dici, in nullo vetere scripto inveniri.''

This doctrine has been called in question by scholars, and the
following passages have been quoted to prove that men did swear
by Castor, and women by Hercules, but they will be found to present
no real difficulty. We must bear in mind the circumstance, to which
we have already adverted in the Prolegomena, that the distribution
of the dialogue among the different characters rests in many cases
solely upon the discretion of the mediaeval transcriber or modern
editor, for it appears certain that in the MS. which was the archetype
of those now existing, the change from one speaker to another was
indicated merely by a blank space, the name of the speaker not
having been inserted. Indeed, in the best existing MS. of Plautus,
the Vetus Codex of Camerarius, the space for the names is left blank
in some of the plays. This being premised‚ we may proceed
to examine the examples which have been adduced in opposition to
the clearly expressed and positive assertion of Varro.

In As. V. ii. the persons on the stage are Artemona, the wife of
Demaenetus, Demaenetus himself, his son Argyrippus, Philenium,
and a parasite. Artemona and the parasite, unseen by the rest,
overhear the conversation of the father, the son, and Philenium; at
ς’. 44 the text os the Vulgate is as follows, Pu. Dic, amabo, an foetet
ausum uxoris tuae? D. ll'autcam Bibere malim, sz' necessum est, quam
illam oscularz'cr. A nr. Miser ecastor es. ΡΛ, Mecastor dzgnus est:
but it would be more appropriate to put the words lllz'ser ecastor es
into the mouth of Philenium, and to make the observation illecastor
dzgnus cs proceed from the angry and insulted wife instead of from
the parasite.

The next example is to bc found in the same scene, v. 80,
D. Totus pcrz‘e'! A. Quid landem f anima soclel nc uxoris tuae?
J). illurrlzam olet. A. Iam subrl'pm'stc' pallam quam scorto dares ι’
