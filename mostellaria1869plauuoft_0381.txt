EXCVRSVS 1V.—JMO. I 95

the purpose of illustrating the doctrine laid down above, and we shall
endeavour to include several passages which might, at first sight,
appear inconsistent nith the view which we have taken of the true
force of z'mo.

It will be observed that such words as hercle, edepol, vera, em'nzvero,
eliam, &c., are not unfrequently combined with imo to render it more
emphatic.

I. Imo frequently signifies plain ‘no,’ more or less forcible
according to circumstances3 frequently it conveys a direct contra·
diction equivalent to ‘the very reverse is true,' and this contradiction
is often indicative of strong emotion on the part of the speaker. On
the other hand, imo may imply merely a polite disclaimer or gentle
remonstrance, in which case it may be rendered by ‘nay’ or ‘nay‚
say not so.’

1. Plain ‘no ;’ Adel. IV. iii. 13, H. Egomet narrabo quae nu'hz‘ dz'xlz'.
M. Imo, ego ibo. H. Benefacz's‚ ‘no, I will go in person ;' Andr. Ι.
i. 2, Sl. Adesdum, paucis le volo. So. Dictum puta, lVempe ul curentur
recte haec. Sz. Imo, aliud. So. Quz'd est? ‘no‚ a different matters
Hec. V. iii. 10, B. Parmeno, obporlune le obsers .· propere curre ad
Pamphilum. P. Quid eos> B. Dic me orare ul veniat. P. Ad le?
Im0‚ ad Philumenam, ‘no, not to my house, to the house of Philu-
mena ;' Curc. II. iii. 44, P. Pernam, abdomen, sumen, suis glandium.
C. Ain lu omnia haec? In carnario forlasse dz'cllrs' P. Imo, in lancibus.
C. ‘You mean perhaps that all these dainties are in the larder?'
P. ίΝΟ, not at all, upon dishes ready to be served up 3’ Andr. ΠΙ. ii.
41, D. Postremo id mihi da negoti: lu lamen idem has nuptias Perge
facere ila ulfacz's .· sed id spero adiuturos deos. S. I mo abi inim, ibi me
opperire, el quod parato opus est para, where imo is ‘no‚' in reply to
id mz'ln' da negolz'‚· v, 10, P. Ehodum, bone vir, quid az'sz' viden me
tuis consiliis Mzkerum inpeditum esse ,ν’ D. At iam expediam. P. Ex-
pedz'es? D. Cerle, Pamphile. P. [Vempe ut modo. D. Imo, mellus
spero. Pamphilus says bitterly, ‘1 suppose you will get me out of
this serape after the same fashion you did just now.' D. ‘No‚ no,
better this time, Ι hope ;’ Heaut. V. i. 62, Quid hoc, quod volo, ul illa
nubat nostro ,ν’ nisi quid est Quod mavis. C. Imo, el gener el adfines
placent: here imo is in reply to the supposition implied by the words
,nisi quid est quod mavis, viz. that Chremes was not satisfied with the
alliance, ‘ no, by no means, both the son—in-law and his relations are
agreeable to me.’

2. Repudiating an idea or proposal in anger3 Andr. V. iii. 15,
