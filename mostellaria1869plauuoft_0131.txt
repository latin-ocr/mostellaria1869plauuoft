METRE AND PROSODY. lxxxix

sz'ltppus, and others, must be considered to afford instances of the
violation of that rule. We shall examine in detail the most remark-
able of these examples‚ and show how insufficient is the evidence
they afford to support the theory that has been built upon them.

The word peristromata occurs twice ε

1. In Stich. ΙΙ. ii. 54, upon which nothing can be founded, for
the MSS„ including the Palimpsest‚ are in the greatest confusion.
The Vulgate‚ which is due to Camerarius,

Tum Babulonz'ca peristromata, consutaque tapetia,

may be readily scanned as a Troch. Tetr. Cat. without doing violence
to the obvious quantity of peristromata. Weise has-—

T um Babulonz'ca peristromata, conchulz'ata tapetia,

which may also be scanned as a Troch. Tetr. Cat. by pronouncing
conclgyhsc'zta. Ritschl has—
T um Babylonica perz'stromatz'a conchyliata tapetia,

which is less plausible than either of the preceding.
2. The second example is in Pseud. Ι. ii. 13,

Vt ne peristromata quidem aeque picta sint Campanz’ca.

Here the MSS. present no important variation‚ and the Vulgate‚
W., and R. acquiesce in the same reading. Editors have regarded
this as a Troch. Tetr. Cat„ in which case it is impossible to scan it
without considering that the three first syllables of peristromata form
an Anapaest; but the line may be scanned without difficulty and
without violating the ordinary rules of quantity as an Iambz'c Tetra-
meter Acatalectz'c‚ and it cannot be objected that an Iambie verse is
here intruded into a series of Trochaics‚ for the measure in this
passage changes in almost every line, and Iambic Tetrameters
immediately follow the verse in question. According to the arrange-
ment of W., we have from the commencement of the scene—

v. 1—5. Tetr. Spondiaci Acat.

6. Dimeter Creticus.

7-9. Cretici Tetram.

10. Iamb. Tetr. Hyperm.

11, 12. Troch. Tetr. Acat.

13, 14. Troch. Tetr. Cat.

15—29. Tetram. Iamb. partim Acat. partim Cat. partim Hypercat.

There is nothing therefore startling or unnatural in supposing that
v. 14 is an Iamb. Tetr. Acat. instead of Troch. Tetr. Cat.

Another example quoted is the word expapillcita found in Mil. IV. iv. 4 4,
