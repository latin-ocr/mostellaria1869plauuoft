NOTES. II. ii. 57—62. 149

Mirum quin te advorsus dicat, i. e. ‘it is very likely that he (your own
slave) will contradict youl’* Aul. I. ii. 7, ,Mirum quin tua nunc me
causasaciat Iuppiter Philzppmn regem aut Darium, trivenefica ,Ι i. e. ‘ it
is very likely, is it not, that Iupiter, for your sake, will make us rich
as king Philip or Dariusl' Cist. IV. ii. 67, Halisca, when inquiring
for the cistella which she had lost, says, Non edepol praeda magna, ‘it
would be no great prize to any one who has found it‚’ to which
Lampadiscus replies, Illirum quin grex venalium in cistella infuerit
una, i. e. ‘it is very likely, is it not, that there should be a troop of
slaves (or anything else of value) in that box of youss1⁷† Merc. Ι. 91,
Mirum quin me subagitaret! ‘it’s very likely, isn’t it, that he would
take liberties with me !’ and so exactly Pers. III. i. 11, iii. 28; Rud. V.
iii. 37; Trin. IV. ii. 125. There is a passage in Pers. ΙΙΙ. iii. 37, in
which mirum is followed by quin, but they are disconnected by a long
stop, and hence the meaning is different3 Τ. Fortasse mettas in manum
concredere. D. Illirum .· quin citius iam a foro argentarii Abeunt, quam
in cursu rotula circumvertitur, i. e. ‘you are perhaps afraid to trust
her in my hands (without payment down),’ to which Dordalus replies
with a sneer, ‘that is wonderful, isn't it! whyI tell you that now-
a-days (even) bankers levant more rapidly than a wheel turns round
when rolling along? The phrases mirum ni, mira sunt ni, mira sunt
nisi, are altogether distinct ; they express real surprise or wonder, and
mean literally, ‘I shall be surprised if so and so is not the case‚' but
generally may be correctly expressed by our ‘I shouldn’t wonder if so
and so is the case5’ thus Amph. I. i. 163, llIirum ni hic me quasi
muraenam exossare cogitat, ‘I shall be surprised if this fellow is not
thinking of boning me as if I were a muraena‚' i. e. ‘I believe that
this fellow is,⁷ *Ι shouldn’t wonder if he were ;' v. 127, lllira sunt
nisi invitabit sese in cena plusculum, i. e. ‘I shouldn't wonder if he
had been taking a drop too much last night;' and again, v. 27 5,
Mira sunt nisi latuit intus illic in illac hirnea, i. e. ‘1 shouldn't be
surprised if that fellow was lying concealed in that wine jar ;' Bac. ΙΙΙ.
iii. 46, Mira sunt ni Pistoclerus Ludum pugnis contudit, ‘I shouldn't
wonder if P. had been giving L. a beating;' Cas. ΙΙΙ. ii. 24, Atque
edepol mirum ni subolet iam hoc huic vicinae meae, ‘indeed Ι shouldn’t
wonder if the lady my neighbour had got an inkling of this already ;’
Trin. IV. ii. 19, Quam magis specto, minus placet mz‘lzz' hominis facies:
mira sunt Ni illie lzomo est aut dormitator, aut sector zonarius, ‘ Ι

* VVeise quite misunderstood the force of this when he renders it velim
eum advorsus te idem edicere, h. e. repetere quod modo dixit.
† Here again W. has completely misunderstood the meaning.
