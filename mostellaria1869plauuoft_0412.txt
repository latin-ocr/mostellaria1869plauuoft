having forgotten the name of Charmides, from whom he pretended
to be the bearer of a letter, Charmides, who is playing with him, says
ironically—C. Vide, homo, ut hominem noveris. S. Tamquam me, ⁴ see
you now then, my good fellow, how far—to what extent—you are
acquainted with this person‚' to which the Sycophanta replies, ‘I
know him as well as 1 know myself.'

This is probably the force of ut in Bac. ΙΙ. ii. 30, Imo ut eum,
credis, misera amans desiderat: all the MSS. have eum, for which
recent editors, following Acidalius, substitute eam, but if we punctuate
as above the change is unnecessary. We have already quoted this
line under imo, p. 199 sub fin.

In Most. III. ii. 146 (144) ut is equivalent to quant0‚· T. Vt
quicquid magis contemplor, tanto mages placet.

4. Vt, ‘how‚' in the sense ‘of what kind' (qualis), as in the
English phrase, ‘how is he as to temper?' thus in Stich. Ι. ii. 55,
where Antipho and Pinacium are discussing mulierum mores, the
latter says—P. Scio ut oportet esse si sint ita ut ego aequom censeo.
A. Volo scire ergo, ut aequom censes. P. Vl per urbem quom ambulent,
Omnibus os opturent ne quts merito maledicat sibi, where the first and
second ut are equivalent to quales ,· so in Cure. Ι. i. 59, Imo ut illam
censes? it is clear from the context that these words are equivalent
to qualem illam censes esse,· so Amph. Prol. 104, Nam ego zvos novisse
credo iam ut sit pater meus, Quam liber harum rerum multarum siet,
‘I take it for granted that you know what kind of person my father
is, how he conducts himself,’ διε.

This force of ut may, not unfrequently‚ be represented by the
English ‘as :' Amph. III. iii. 4, Atque ita servom par videtur frugi
sese instituere, Proinde heri ut sint, epse item sit, where Proinde ut,
‘just as‚' is equivalent to quales ,· so Capt. 11. i. 32, Ero, ut me voles
esse, ‘I shall be as you wish me to be,' i. e. ‘such as' talis· qualem‚·
and again, v. 39, qunc ut te mihi volo esse, esse autumo,· Truc. II. vii.
16, meretricem ego item esse reor mare ut est, ‘such as is the sea‚'
talem quale.

In Men. II. iii. 78, Mes. Quid ergo.) Mes. Opus est. Mes. Quid
opus est ,² Max. Scio, ut me dices. Mes. Tanto nequior es : the text
is probably corrupt.

5. Vt, ‘how,' has frequently an explanatory force in dependent
clauses; thus in English, ‘I will tell you how it happened,’ ‘let us
consult how we may best assist him‚’ and the like. In all such cases
ut, in Latin, must be followed by the subjunctive: Poen. Ι. i. 66,
Abeamus intro ut Collubt‘scum villicum Ηαηῑ perdoceamus ut serat
