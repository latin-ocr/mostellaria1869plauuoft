is placed Herculem sub terram mediam cubantem: sub quem plurimum
aurum positum est. 2. But the power of the God was by no means
restricted within the narrow limits indicated above, for we learn from
Diodorus Siculus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who enter into
minute details, that he was worshipped generally as the bestower of
wealth, and that those who had accumulated great riches were wont,
in gratitude or in the fulfilment of a vow, to dedicate to him a tithe
of all their possessions. It will be seen from the quotations given at
length below, that both authors carry back the origin of this practice
to a remote mythical epoch—to the period when Hercules passed
over into Italy from Spain—and both distinctly state that it still
prevailed when they wrote. The former states specifically that
Lucullus, having calculated the amount of his fortune, consecrated
a tithe of the whole to Hercules, and expended the amount in a long
series of costly banquets, and this statement is corroborated by
Plutarch, who relates the same of Sulla and of Crassus, and proposes
as the subject of one of his Roman Problems (15), Διὰ τί τῳ Ἡρακλεῖ
πολλοὶ τῶν πλουσίων ἐδεκάτευον τὰς οὐσίαςς These passages are so im—
portant that they deserve to be quoted. After having narrated the
hospitable reception of Hercules by the aborigines who had a town
upon the Palatine, Diodorus proceeds (IV. 21), ‘o δ’ οὖν Ἡρακλῆς·
ἀποδεξάμενος τὴν εὔνοιαν τῶν τὸ Παλάτιον οἰκούντων, προεῖπεν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι
μετὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ μετάστασιν εἷς· θεοὺς, τοῖς εὐξαμένοις ἐκδεκατεύσειν Ἠρακλεῖ
τὴν οὐσίαν, συμβήσεται τὸν βίον εὐδαιμονέστερον ἕξειν. ὃ καὶ συνέβη κατὰ
τοὺς ὕστερον χρόνους διαμεῖναι μέχρι τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς χρόνων. πολλοὺς γὰρ
Ῥωμαίων, οὐ μόνον τῶν συμμέτρους οὐσίας κεκτημένων, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν μεγα-
λοπλούτων τινὰς, εὐξαμένους ἐκδεκατεύσειν Ἠρακλεῖ, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα γενομένους
εὐδαίμονας, ἐκδεκατεῦσαι τὰς οὐσίας οὔσας ταλάντων τετρακισχιλίων. Λεύ-
κολλος γὰρ ὁ τῶν καθ’ αὑτὸν Ῥωμαίων σχεδόν τι πλουσιώτατος ὢν, διατιμησά-
μενος τὴν ἰδίαν οὐσίαν, κατέθυσε τῷ θεῷ πᾶσαν τὴν δεκάτην, εὐωχίας ποιῶν
συνεχεῖς καὶ πολυδαπάνους. κατεσκεύασαν δέ καὶ Ῥωμαῖοι τούτῳ τῷ Θεῷ παρὰ
τὸν Τίβεριν ἱερὸν ἀξιόλογον, ἐν ᾧ νομίζουσι συντελεῖν τὰς ἐκ τῆς δεκάτης
evolas—where, it, must be remarked, Diodorus speaks of facts within
his own knowledge and observation. In like manner Dionysius (A. R.
I. 40) after recounting the legend of the erection of an altar in honour
of Hercules by Evander and of the sacrifice of a tithe of his spoils by
the hero himself, concludes with these words: *ο δὲ βωμὸς, ἐφ’ οὗ τὰς
δεκάτας ἐπέθυσεν Ἱ-Ιρακλῆς, καλεῖται μὲν ὑπὸ Ῥωμαίων Μέγιστος, ἔστι δέ
Βοαρίας λεγομένης ἀγορᾶς πλησίον, ἁγιστευόμενος εἷ καί τις ἄλλος ὑπὸ τῶν
ἐπιχωριών. ὅρκοι τε γὰρ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ καὶ συνθῆκαι τοῖς βουλομένοις βεβαίως τι

διαπράττεσθαι, καὶ δεκατεύσεις χρημάτων γίνονται συχναὶ κατ’ εὐχάς. Τῇ
