was not limited to Socrates but extended to Fimbria also ;' Cic. de
Div. Ι. 39, ᾧ 36, chmo aliter philosophus sensit, in quo modo esset
auctor-ilas, ‘provided only he were a man of weight.' Cicero wishes
to qualisy the expression lVemo philosophus as too comprehensive, and
to limit his assertion to those whose names carried auctoritas with
them. Cic. de Senect. VJI. ξ 22, ΛῙαηεηί ingenia senibus, modo per-
maneat studium el industria, ‘ provided only :¹ here again modo fixes
a limit to the proposition manent ingenia senibus, which would not be
true unless thus restricted. Phor. Ι. ii. 17, is senem per ept'slulas
Perlexil, modo non montes auri pollicens, ‘only not promising,' ‘pro-
mising everything short of whole hills of gold‚' ‘the only limit to his
promises was’ &a This is the Greek μόνον ὀυχί. Cf. Tibull. 1. i.
25. Modo is frequently used after an imperative, in dialogue, when
a certain amount os impatience or indignation is implied: so As. V.
ii. 19, Tace moab, ‘only hold your tongue,' ‘I limit my request to
this,’ ‘all Ι ask is, hold your tongue;’ Men. IV. i. 4, Quz'n lu taces . . .
sequere hac modo, ‘only follow me,' ‘I limit my request to this: ‘all
I ask is ;’ Rud. III. iii. 29, Sedete hic modo,- Men. I. iii. 32, Propera

modo.

Π. Modo signifying ‘just now’ or ‘this moment! Modus, as
stated above, signifies generally ‘a measure,¹ specially it denotes ‘a
measure of time,’ ‘an unit of time‚' and is employed with reference
to the unit of time immediately preceding an event; or, during which
an event is taking place ; or, immediately following an event. So in
English we say, 1. he was here just now, this moment, this instant;
2. he is here just now (this moment, this instant); 3. he will be here
just now, this moment, this instant.

grammarian remarks, ‘⁴ Difficile invenitur praesentis temporis modo.'’

3. Future time: Andr. III. iv. 15, Domum mado ibo. We fre-
quently sind a double ruodo, in which case the first signifies ‘at one
moment.' the second ‘at another moment,’ and hence ‘sometimes
