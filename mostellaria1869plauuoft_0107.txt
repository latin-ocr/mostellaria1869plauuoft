of the first long syllable of the Cretic, and thus the scientific name
would be Cretic Tetrameter Brachycatalectic‚ while such lines as

Callz'dzlr dolis

are in like manner Cretic Dirneter Brachycatalectic.

Although Cretic verses are extremely common in Plautus, they
are very rare in Terence. An isolated line may here and there be
picked out, as in Adel. IV. iv. 1,

Discrucior animi
Hoccz'ne ex improviso mali mihi obici,

where Bentley has substituted ex for the MS. reading de. The only
example of a continuous series is to be found in Andr. IV. i. 1,
which are thus arranged by Bentley, the first being a pure Dactylic
Tetram. Acat., and the nine following Cretic Tetrarn. Acat.—

It is well known that the Hiatus is occasionally, although sparingly,
admitted by the epic and lyric poets. We might have anticipated,
a priori, that it would take place rnore frequently in familiar dialogue,
and we are positively assured by Cicero that such was the practice
of the older poets. When speaking of the tendency of the speech of
the Romans to run together vowels, opposed to the practice of many
among the Greeks, he goes on (Orator. c. 45), ‘ Sed Graeci viderint:
nobis ne si cupiamus quidem distrahere voces conceditur. Indicant
orationes illae ipsae horridulae Catonis, indicant omnes poetae praeter
eos qui ut versum facerent saepe hiabant, ut Naevius,

Vos qui accolitis Histrum flumen, alque algidam
Et ibidem
Quam numquam vobis Graii alque Barbari
