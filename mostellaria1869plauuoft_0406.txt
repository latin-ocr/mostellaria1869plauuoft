2 l 8 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

asks with what malady the patient to whom he had been called is
affected, on which the old man replies testily‚ Quin ea te causa duco
ut id dicas mihi, ‘why‚ Ι tell you, I am taking you to him sor this
very reason, that you may tell me what his malady is! Impatience
and indignation: Men. V. viii. 2, illem Men' hodie usquam convenisse te,
audax, audes dte-cre, Postquam advorsum mihi imperavi ul huc venires?
Mes. Quin modo Eripui, ‘met you! why, just now I rescued you!
Great indignation: Cas. ΙΙ. ἱί. 22, Vir me habet pessumis despicatam
modis ...... . . Quin mihi ancillulam zbtgratis postulat,
quae mea est, Quae meo educata sumplu est, villico suo se darc, ‘why, he
even goes the length of insisting‚' &c.

Quin is affirmative in Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 77, Ηενείε, quin tu recte dicis et
tibi adsentior ego, ‘by Hercules, but thou sayest well :’ we have the
Same phrase again, V. iv. 47, Men. ΙΙ. iii. 74, and, slightly varied,
in V. ix. 33, Hercle quin tu me admonuisti recle, el habeo gratiam.
It denotes strong affirmation in Poen. IV. ii. 86, S. Przffecto ad in-
citas lenonem rediget si eas abduxerit. All. Quin prius disperibit, saxo,
quam unam calcem civerit. Ita paralum est, ‘but I am determined
that he shall be utterly destroyed before he shall have made a single
move: Ι have taken measures to that effect!

Frequently quin is not a simple affirmative, but adds something
which gives greater force or emphasis to the question or remark of
the preceding speaker ; thus Most. 11. ii. 25, Tu. An tu tetigisti has
aedes? T ll. Cur non tangerem ,ν’ Quin pultando, inquam, paene cousm’gi
fores, ‘not only have Ι touched the door, but, more than that, Ι tell
you that Ι have almost smashed it to pieces by battering it ;' so Cas.
III. i. 7, S. Fac vacent aedes. A Quin, edepol, servos, ancillas, domo
Certum est omnes mittere ad te, i. e. ‘not only will I see to that, but,
more than that, Ι have resolved' διο. ; Men. V. iv. 7, S. „Magna cum
cura ego illum curari volo. M. Quin suspirabo plus sexcenties in die :
Ita ego illum cum cura ego magna curabo tibi. The commentators have
missed the sense of this passage; there is a pun on the double
meaning of cura, which may signify, as in English, either simply
‘ diligence’ or ‘mental anxiety :⁵ S. ‘I wish him to be cared for with
great care.' M. ‘Why‚ sor that matter, I will heave sighs os care
more than six hundred times a day, so great shall be the care with
which I will take care of him sor you.'

When quin is used in this sense it is sometimes followed by ettam,-
thus Most. ΙΙ. i. 74, [Herus] iussit maxumo Opere orare, ut patrem
aliquo apsterrcrcs modo ,Ne introiret aedis. T. Quin etiam illi hoc
dicito Facturum ut ne etiam aspicere aedis audeat, i. e. ‘tell him that
