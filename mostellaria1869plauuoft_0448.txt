260 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

The occupation itsels was called Carnuficina‚ Cist. 11. i. 1; and
those who practised it were said carmeficinam facere, Capt. I. ii. 29,
equivalent to which is facere quaestum carcerarium, v. 26. The
employment was by no means honourable nor popular, and hence
no term of vituperation is more common than carnufex.

The word Lorarii is found in the Dramalis Personae and stage
directions of some plays, but does not occur in the text of any
classical author. Aulus Gellius (N. A. Χ. 3) tells us that, after the
departure of Hannibal from Italy, the Romans refused to acknow-
ledge the Bruttii as socii, or to enrol thern as soldiers, but employed
thern to discharge servile duties for provincial governors—“Itaque
hi sequebantur magistratus, tamquam in scenicis fabulis qui dice-
bantur lorariz‘, et quos erant iussi vinciebant et verberabant.’'

Sometimes fantastic terms are used: thus Truc. IV. iii. 8, Nisi si
ad tintinnaculos vos voltis educi viros, where the tintinnaculi viri are
the floggers who make the scourge sing or whistle about the ears of
the sufferers: in like manner Pseud. Ι. iii. 98, Lanios inde arcessam
duos cum tintinnabulis. Eadem duo greges virgarum inde ulmearum ad-
egero,· with which compare Rud. ΙΙΙ. ν. 2 5, D. Ehem J optume edepol,
eccum clavator advenit. L. Illud quidem edepol tinnimentum est auribus,-
while in Pers. ΙΙ. iii. 12 we have another expression sor the sound
of the lash upon the fiesh, Diu quod bene erit die uno apsolvam, tax tax
tergo meo crit.

We may conclude by quoting some lines from As. 111. ii. r, which
give a sort of summary of the tortures inflicted upon slaves3 Perfidiae
laudes gratiasque habemus merito magnas, Quom nostris sucophantiis‚
dolis, astutiisque, Scapularum considerata, virtute ulmorum freti, Qui
advorsum stimulos, laminas, crucesque, compedesque Mrvos, catenas,
carceres, numellas, pedicas, boias, Indoctoresque acerrimos, gnarosque
nostri tergi, Qui saepe ante in nostras scapulas cicatrices indiderunt ,·
and with these we may compare Men. V. vi. 8, Recordetur id, qui
nihili sunt, quid iis preti Detur ab suis heris, ignavis, inprobis Viris .·
verbera, compedes, molae, magna Lassitudo, fames, frigus durum, Haec
pretia sunt ignaviae. A few os the words given above may require
explanation, in addition to what has been said already.

Laminae were thin plates os metal raised to a red heat and applied
to the flesh: they are spoken os by Lucretius, 111. 1029, Verbera, car-
nufices, robur, pix, lamina, taedae; by Cicero, In Verr. Act. II. v. 63,
Quid quum ignes ardentesque laminae ceterique cruciatus admovebantur?
and by Horace, Epp. Ι. Χν. 36. Scilicet ut ventres lamna candente nen
potum Diceret urendos corrector Bestius.
