ν 16. gnarures . . . hanc rem.] We cannot draw any distinction as
to meaning between gnarus and gnaruris. The latter occurs again
in Poen. Prol. 47, Ad argumentum nunc vicissatim volo Rengrare‚
aeque ut mecum sitis gnarures, but it is not found elsewhere until we
corne down to Arnobius and Ausonius. Forcellini marks the pen-
ultimate long, gnaruris. The versification in the passage before us
is so uncertain that it cannot be employed in evidence, while in the
line from the Poenulus, which is an Iambic Trimeter, the penultimate
must be short3 and so also in Auson. Epp. XXII. 19, Non cultor
instans non arator gnaruris, which line also is an Iambic Trimeter.
The young scholar will remark the accusative after gnarures governed,
we must suppose, by the verb implied in the adjective.

18. examussim] i. e. ‘true to rule and plummet.’ While, strictly,
regula signifies ‘a straight rule,' norma ‘two straight rules joined at
right angles,’ that is, ‘a square,’ perpendiculum ‘a plumb-line,’ libella
‘the combination of a rule and plummet,’ and rubrica ‘the chalked
cord' used by masons, amussis would seem to denote a carpenter's or
mason's ‘level,’ that is, an instrument used to ascertain that a surface
is perfectly horizontal. This at least seems to be the meaning of
Varro, as quoted by Nonius (s. v. Examussz'm p. 9), amussis est aequa-
men levamentum, id est apud fabros tabula quaedam qua ulunlur ad saxu
coagmentata,· and of Paul. Diae. (s.v.‚ p. 6, ed. Mun), who explains it
as regula ad quam aliquid exaequalur, although, in all probability, the
whole of the above words were employed indifferently when technical
language was not required* See Auson. Eidyll. XVI. 11, where wc
have the nominative amussis. Ad amussim, or, in one word, Adamas-
Vsz'm, is found in Varro R. R. II. 1, Sz' inquam, numerus non est ul sil
ad amussim, which means, if the number given is not ‘precisely
exact;’ and in Aul. Gell. Ι. 4, XX. 1, Macrob. S. Ι. 4, it means in like
manner, ‘to a nicety‚ exactly.' Examussim is found again in Plaut.
Amph. II. ii. 213, Nae isla edepol, si haec vera loquz'lur, examussim esl
· optima, i. e. ‘is absolutely perfect 3’ and Men. Prol. 50, Vt hanc rem
vobis examussim disputem, i. e. ‘with perfect accuracy and distinetness ;’
and reappears later in Apuleius. In Mil. III. i. 38 we have amus-
sz'tala, the participle of a verb amussim, Inest z‘n hoc amussz'lala sua
sz'bz' ingenua indoles, i. e. ‘a liberal disposition squared and balanced
according to the nicest rule of right.’

25. legulas embricesque] Imbrex is probably the gutter or open

* Sisenna, quoted by Charis. p. 178, makes amussis an instrument for
determining that a wall is built perpendicularly.
