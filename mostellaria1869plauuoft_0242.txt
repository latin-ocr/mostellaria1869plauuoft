ACTVS IV. SCENA I.

PHA NI S C VS.

Servi qui quom culpa carint tamen malum metuont

Hi solent esse heris utibiles.

Nam illi qui nihil metuont postquam sunt malum meriti
Stulta sibi expetunt consilia.

Exercent sese ad cursuram: fugiunt. Sed hi si reprehensi

Faciunt a malo peculium quod nequeunt [a bono]-
Augent ex pauxillo [thesaurum in] de parant.

Mihi in pectore consilii [quod est, lubet cavere] malam

The following scene appears under a very mutilatcd form in the MSS.
In order to elicit any sense, a few additions and changes must be made
upon conjecture, but these are, with one or two exceptions‚ not very
serious. Hermann, Ritchl‚ and some other modern editors, following the
ignis fatuus of metrical systems, have made alterations which are altogether
unjustifiable, and do not deserve to be noticed, except as ingenious flights
of imagination. We have taken the text as it appears in B as the ground-
work3 this has been occasionally improved by comparing it with CD, but
in several instances the corruptions affect all alike. The words within
brackets are supplements introduced by various scholars to supply the
blanks which occur in the MSS.

The names of persons prefixed to this scene in B are-TRANIQ
THEVROPIDES, Sum, DANISTA.

1. quom CF. quom B.

2. There is a blank in B after solent, as if one or two words had
dropped out, but this does not appear in CDFZ, and the sense seems
to be complete without any addition. eris all the MSS. ero vv. 18
and 21. erus vv, 22 and 35. u

3. metuunt CDFZ. metunt B. The correction apparently by the
first hand.

5. reprehensi CDF. reprehensi& B, with a dot under the s in black ink.

6. fatiunt B. faciunt CDFZ. v. 38fat1'am all, at least B. pecu-
lium is a conj. of Pylades. The MSS. have peculio, but the transition
from peculi& (i. e. peculiom) to peculio is so slight and so common, that the
correction may be regarded as certain. [α bono]‚ so W. This seems
to be more simple than the Vulg. nequeunt [facere de suo], which was
introduced by Acidalius.

7. [thesaurum in]‚ the blank was thus filled by Camerarius, and so the
Vul . WR.

8.g consilii B. consili CD. [quod est, lubet cave1·e]‚ this also is a
guess of Carne-rariua, adopted in the Vulg.
