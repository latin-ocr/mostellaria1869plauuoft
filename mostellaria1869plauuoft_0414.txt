so in English ‘as' and ‘when' are frequently convertible—we may
say, ‘ he came as I was at dinner’ or ‘ whewI was at dinner‚’ ‘I saw
him as I was sitting in a shop' or ‘when Iwas sitting :' so Merc.
Prol. 99, Discubitum noctu ut imus, ecce ad me advenit, i. e. ‘ as we
were going to bed‚' or ‘when we' &c.; As. ΙΙ. ii. 76, Verum in
tonstrina ut sedebam, me infit percontarier, i. e. ‘ as Iwas sitting,' or
‘when I was sitting! Vt semel signifies ‘as soon as:’ Truc. 1. ii. 6,
Vt semel adveniunt ad scorta congerrones.

Vt with a perfect tense must often be rendered as if it were
postquam, as in the following examples: Most. 1. iii. 63, Eumdem
animum oportet nunc mihi esse gratum ut empetravi, Atque olt'm‚ prius-
quam, i. e. postquam impetravi,· Capt. III. i. 18, lVam ul dudum hinc
abii, adcessi ad adulescentes in foro‚· Men. IV. ii. 71, Quin ut dudum
divorti aps te, redeo nunc demum domum,· Epid. IV. ii. 30, Quid ego?
qui illam ut primum vidi, numquam vidi postea‚· Most. Ι. iii. 111, Vt
speculum tenuisti, metuo ne oleant argentum manus. We may compare
the well-known line in Virgil, Ecl. VIII. 41, Vt vidi, ut perii, ut me
malus abstulit error!

Vt followed by quemque signifies ‘when' in the sense os ‘as soon
as ε’ As. Ι. iii. 93, Supplz'cabo, exopsecrabo, ut quemque amicum videro;
Men. III. ii. 56, Quid hoc negoti estt' Satin ut quemque conspicor, Ita
me ludzficantc'

ΙΙ. Vt signisying ‘that.’

1. Vt, ‘that,’ is occasionally used in what we may term a
rhetorical question, that is, a question not put for the sake of
obtaining information, but as a mode of expressing the indignati0n‚
scorn‚ contempt, or ridicule entertained by the speaker for some
statement or opinion expressed by another. In all such cases there
is an aposiopesis before ut, and the blank must be mentally sup-
plied: thus Truc. ΙΙ. iv. 87, Egone illam ut non amem! egone illi ut
non bene velim J ⁴(is it possible) that Ι should not love her? (is it
possible to believe) that I should not wish her well?' IV. ii. 28,
D. Illt'ne ut inimici mei Bona istic comedant ,θ Illortuom, hercle, me
quam ut z'd patiar mavelim, ‘·(is it to be endured) that those my
enemies should eat up in that house my good things?’ Trin. ΙΙΙ. iii.
21, Vt ego nunc adulescenti thesaurum indicem Indomz'to, pleno amoris
ac lasciviae? Minume, minume hercle vero, ‘ (what! do you advise)
that I should reveal the hoard,’ &c.; Men. IV. iii. 9, Mzbiut tu
mebris pallam et spinther? qumquanz jactum reperies, ‘ (what, have
you the assurance to assei-t) that you gave 1ne a shawl and a
l›uckle?' Pers. 1. iii. 51, T. Hic leno neque te novit neque gnatam
