146 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

valeatve ostium ‚³ Ρη. Bellissumum hercle vidie! taciturm'ssumum, qum-
quam ullum verbum mutit, quom aperitur, tacet‚· Quomque illa noctu
clanculum ad me exit, tacet ,· and at the end of the same scene, v. 93,
Vide! ut aperiuntur aedes festivzssumae ! lVon mutit cardo. Est lepz‘dus.
P. Quin das suavium? and again in the same play, I. iii. 1, Placide
egredere, ct sonitum prohibe sorum, et crepitum cardinum ,· and Trin V.
i. 8, sed fores Hae sonitu suo mihi moram iniciunt incommode. Some
of the older commentators however imagine that the doors of the
dwelling houses opened outwards directly upon the street, so that
every one who issued forth rattled the door before opening it, in
order to give warning to passers by. According to this view, when,
in v. 75, Tranio is endeavouring to srighten Theuropides and to
make him believe that the outraged ghost is about to sally forth, he
exclaims‚ Concrepuit soris ! IJicce'ne percussit? i. e. ‘the door rattlesl
was it he (the ghost) who smote on it ?'

42. Sermonem nostrum qui aucupet] Plautus is fond of the meta-
phor derived from the watchsul stillness and artifices os a bird-catcher3
so As. V. ii. 31, Aucupemus ex insidiis clanculum quam rem gerant ,·
Mil. IV. i. 43, Viden tu illam oculis venaturam facere, atque aucupium
auribus,· so ii. 5; Men, IV. i. 12, Huc concedamus: ex insidiis aucupa,-
Rud. IV. iv. 49, Viden scelestus ut aucupatur, ‘is playing off his lures ;’
Truc. V. 72, Lepide mecastor aucupavi, ‘I have had capital sport.'

44. Capitalis caedis sacta est] i. e. ‘ an atrocious murder was
committed.' Caedis is another form of the more common nomi-
native caedes‚ as we find aedis for acdes,· torquis for torques, and canis
and canes. The epithet capitalis is emphatic, since caedes or caedis
would not, taken alone, necessarily imply murder. Young scholars
are apt to be embarrassed by the word capitalis. As there is a want
of distinctness in some even of our best dictionaries in regard to the
modifications of meaning assumed by this word, and their connection
with each other, we shall say a few words on the subject. Caput
signifies* (ι) ‘the head.' (2) The head being regarded by many
ancient physiologists as the seat of the vital principle, Caput denoted
‘the lise.’ (3) Caput was used by the jurists to designate ‘the poli-
tical life' of a Roman citizen, and comprehended the whole amount
of his privileges as a free man, as a member of a family, and as a
civis optimo iure. Hence when an individual from any cause suffered
the loss of these privileges, or of any portion of them, he was said

* We notice here those leading meanings only of caput which are

iliffessagy for our present purpose. For others see notes on Ι. iii. 54,
. 1. 0.
