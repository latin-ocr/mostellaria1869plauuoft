so scelestus, ‘unlucky wretch that I am,¹ Rud. III. v. 223 scelestius,
‘more unfortunate,’ Men. III. i. 2; scelestis-sumum, ‘most wretched,'
Cas. III. v. 34; me infilicem et scelestam, Cist. IV. ii. 17 ; cf. Rud.
IV. iv. 123; mihi scelesto, Rud. II. vi. 18; and advantage is
sometimes taken of the double meaning, as in As. ΙΙ. iv. 69, Age,
impudice, Sceleste. L. Non audes mihi scelesto subvenire. There is a
close analogy between the use of scelestus and the English adjective
wretched, which is ambiguous, since it may be applied to a man who
is simply unhappy, or to a man in an unhappy position from guilt.
So also ‘ you wretch' and ‘he is a wretch’ are vituperative, while both
may be employed playfully; 'not so, however, ‘wretch that I aml'
So we talk of wretched weather, a wretched harvest, a wretched year
forsarmers, and the like.

23. aut meam speciem alios inridere] Cf. III. ii. 125 (123), Ergo
inridere ne videare et gestire admodum (here absolutely) 3 V. ii. 11
(iii. 11), Verbero, etiam inrides!³ again absolutely. Examples of in-
ridere with the accusative may be found in Pseud. V. ii. 195 Poen. V.
ii. 71; Pers. V. ii. 26; Merc. 11..i. 26.

²9· Catus] For catus Cf. V. ii. 21 (iii. 21), Hercle mihi tecum
cavendum est: nimis quam es orator catus. ’

32. illi Illorem praecipue sic geras] Morem gerere alicui denotes
that a person suits or accommodates his or her ways and wishes to
those of another, and hence signifies generally, ‘to comply with,’ ⁴ to
obey.' We have several examples in this play; Ι. iii. 43, 69; 11. i.
51; III. i. 50 (51); ii. 36 (37): see also Pers. IV. iv, 553 Capt. II.
iii. 44; Cure. Ι. ii. 62; Men. V. ii. 37. Sometimes the phrase is ap-
plied to one who indulges his own inclinations, e. g. Amph. Prol. 131,
Pater nunc intus suo animo morem gerit. From the combination
morem gerere are formed the adjective morigerus and the verb mori-
gero or morigeror,- so below, ΙΙ. i. 51, Morzgrerae libi erimus ambae,-
and in Cist. I. iii. 27, Ea diem suum obiit, sacta mot-egem est viro,
i. e. ‘she did what her husband wished her to do—she died ;' and
I. i. 86, de ea re gessit morem morzgerae mihi, i. e. ‘in that matter
my mother yielded to me, who in other matters was obedient
to her ;’ and with moribus in Men. I. iii. 19, Cape tibi hanc (sc. pal-
lam) .· quando una vivis meis morzgera moribus. See also Cas. II.
viii. 29; Curc. Ι. ii. 70; Amph. III. iii. 26; Epid. V. i. 1. The verb
is less common, but is found in both the active and deponent
sorm3 Amph. ΙΙΙ. iii. 26, Volo deludi illum, dum cum hac usuraria
onre nunc mihi morzger0‚· and Capt. ΙΙ. i. 4, Nunc servitus si evenit,
ei vos morigerari mos bonus est. The simple word mos is occasionally
