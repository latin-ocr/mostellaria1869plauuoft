METRE AND PROSODY. cxi

Tabernaculum. This word appears twice in the syncopated form,
tabernacl0, in Amph. I. i. 270, 272 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

In tabernaclo, id quidem hodie numquam poterit dicere,

and Quid in tabernaclo jecisti? Victus sum si dixeris.

 

In the second of these lines quid z'n must be pronounced as one
long syllable, but neither of them decide the quantity of the first
syllable in tabernaculo, which does not, as far as I know, occur in
any of the poets of the Augustan age. Taberna is found in several
passages in Plautus, but not one of these decides the quantity of the
first syllable, which is however unquestionably short in the Augustan

poets. Terence affords no example. But in Trin. III. ii. 100
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚ we find—

Cas-sidem in caput, dormibo placide in tabernaculo,

and this is the reading of all the MSS. Now this line, as it stands,
cannot be scanned unless upon the supposition that tabernaculo has
the first long. Hermann proposes to substitute contubernio, while
R. changes placide into placz‘dule‚ and thus scans in labernlacnlla
We must therefore either adhere to the MSS. and suppose that
tabernaculum has the first long; or, adopt contubernio, as proposed
by Herm. ; or else adopt the conj. emend, placidule, and suppose
that tabernaculo has the second short. Few will hesitate to conclude
that whatever the difficulties of the case may be, the remedy proposed
by R. is much more violent than the disease, and that therefore we
have no evidence whatever of a violation of the Rule of Position in
this case.

Taberna occurs six times in Plautus. In five of these passages
the first syllable may be long or short without affecting the verse.
The sixth instance is Pseud. IV. vii. 14 (Cret. Tetr. ?)‚

Nam me in taberna usque adhuc siverat Surus.

If the line is, as W. sets it down, a Cretic Tetrameter, taberna would
seem to be required. I cannot however scan it comfortably as such,
but both the text and the arrangement of lines are very uncertain.
R. gives an unexceptionable Tetr.,

Nam in taberna usque adhuc siverat [me] Surus,

but me is not found in the MSS.; and even admitting this reading,
the rst foot might be a Molossus.

Somewhat analogous, at first sight, to the case of tabernaculum is
bo‘lentarius. Cure. ΙΙ. iii. 16 (T roch. Tetr. Cat.)‚
