perhaps apple-green, in his long catalogue of dresses of different
forms and shades, Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 49, cumatile aut plumatile, cerinum aut
melinum; again Plautus uses melina to denote a purse or wallet made
of sheepskin (μῆλον) or badger-skin (meles); Epid. Ι. i. 20, Sed ubi
est is? T. Adveni simul. E. Vbi is ergo est.) nisi si in vidulo, Aul si
in melina allum-li,- and in another passage melina is employed for
a wine sweetened with honey (μέλι), Pseud. II. iv. 51, Quid, si opus
sit, ut dulce promat indidem ,θ’ ecquid habet) C. Rogas? Murrhmam,
passum, defrutum, melinum, mel quoius—modi. Quin in corde instruere

107, 118. Offuciam. Fuc0.] Fucus, according to Pliny H. N. XIII.
25, ξ 48, is a general term for marine shrubs, and he tells us that the
Latin language has no word equivalent to the Greek φῦκος, quoniam
alga herbarum magis vocabulum inlellz'gz'lur, hic aulem est frutex. He
goes on to describe three species growing on the rocks by the sea
shore, one of these a native of Crete‚* and elsewhere speaks of
it as communicating a very fast red colour to wool. There can be
little doubt that Pliny, or at least his authorities, intended to indicate
by the word sucus some of the tinctorial hebens, of which a con-
siderable number are found upon maritime rocks in the Mediterranean,
and even on our own shores, especially those which yield the red or
purple colours, and form the principal constituents of the dye stuff
known as archil. The most celebrated of these is the roccella tinc-
toria, which many modern writers have supposed to be identical with
the πόντιον φῦκος Of Theophrastus, the φῦκος θαλάσσιον Of DioscorIdeS,
the phycos lhalassz‘on or sucus of Pliny. Dioscorides denies that the
paint used by women was made from this plant, and asserts that it
was a root bearing the same name, and hence in our dictionaries we
find it frequently stated that sucus means the anchusa lz'nclorz'a or
alkanet root. A German botanist (Endlicher) has recently maintained
that the sucus of the ancient was obtained from one of the algae,
the rylsplzlaea tinctorio, from which a red colour can be extracted.†
Hence the word sucus is used to signify generally a dye or pigment,
chiefly red, from whatever source obtained, as in the passage before

* And yet in XXXII. 6, § 22, he ter-ms this very plant an alga—Lauda-
tissima (alga maris, sc.) quae in Creta insula iuxta terram in petris nascitur,
tinguendis etiam lanis ita colorem adligans, ut elui postea non possit,· and in
XXVI. 10, § 66, he mentions the medicina] properties of the same planus,
which he comprehends under the name of plvrcos thalassion id est fuc12s

marinus, describing the three varieties and alluding to Crete as the habitat
of that used in dyeing.
