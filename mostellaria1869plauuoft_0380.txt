ί 94 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

“Hoc est, quare adhuc (etiam) cupiam vivere,” but rather, ‘this is
an additional motive for making me desire to live! In the same
scene, Planesium having used the word odium in reference to Pali-
nurus, he, in wuith, rejoins, v. 34, Quid ais, propudium! Tun elsam
cum noctuinis oculis ‘odium’ me vocas Ρ where the meaning may be
‘do you, even now (standing there before us), with those owl-eyes of
yours, call me an abomination?’ (With respect to the use of the
word odium in this passage, we may observe that although we can
talk in English of a person being ‘a love,’ we can scarcely term
any one ‘a hate‚' probably because we have no familiar personifi-
cation of Hate.)

1V.-IMO.

Imo or Immo (for the etymology and orthography are alike uncer-
tain *) occurs very frequently in the dramatic writers, and no word is
more likely to puzzle a young scholar, in consequence of the conflict-
ing opinions expressed by lexicographers, grammarians, and commen-
tators. According to some high authorities imo properly signifies ‘no,'
according to others ‘ yes‚' according to others either ‘yes' or ‘ no.’†

I feel no difficulty in asserting that wherever imo occurs in the
dramatists it always denotes dissent on the part of the speaker from
some statement made, or from some opinion or idea enunciated
previously. This dissent, however, comprises every modification,
from a direct and vehement contradiction to a slight correction of
or improvement upon what has been said, such correction or im-
provement tending, in many cases, not to overthrow but to strengthen
and confirm the assertion to which it refers.

There is no doubt that imo may sometimes be translated fairly
by ‘yes,' but in those cases only where, according to our idiom‚ ‘ yes’
is intended to rebut a negation, and is in reality equivalent to ‘on
the contrary.’ Thus, when A says to B, ‘You can sing? B. ‘No
I cannot.' A. ‘Yes you can'—‘ yes' is intended to contradict the ‘ no'
of B, and really means, ‘on the contrary, you can sing, what you say
is not true.' In what follows we shall give a series of examples sor

* E. g. Scheller and Freund would connect it with imus, Doederlein
with ἐτυμως. Mr. Long (in Cic. Verr. Act. 11. i. 1) considers that it
stands for in modo.

† See the dictionaries of Forcellini and Freund, the grammars of Rams-
horn, Zumpt, Madvig and Kcy; the note of Long on Cic. Verr. Act. 11.
i. 1, and of Macleane on Juvenal XVI. 9. Ramshorn says distinctly that
imo is to be rendered “bald durch Ja ewohl hald durch Ο nein.'‘
