dicis? S. arsacio lucri Vt Praenestinis conia est ciconia. There are
some remarks upon this word in Aul. Gell. XVII. 2, who quotes a
passage from Claudius Quadrigarius, and adds “ nunc arrabo in sor-
didis verbis haberi coeptus, ac multo rectius videtur arra, quamquam
arra quoque veteres saepe dixerunt, et compluriens Laberius.''

1 16. Apsolve hunc, quaem, vomitum] Unless vomitus be taken here
in a general sense to signify ‘ filth‚' it must mean ‘an emetic,’ ⁴ some-
thing causing sickness3’ usually, however, it is employed to denote
the act of vomiting or the result. Thus Merc. ΙΙΙ. iii. 14, Senex hir-

cosus, lu osculere mulierem? Vtt'ne adveniens vomitum excutias mulieri? ”

and Rud. II. vi. 26, L. Perii, animo male fit! contine, quaem, caput.
C. Pulmoneum edepol nz'mz's velim vomitum vomas, i. e. ‘it is all over
with me, I am sick, hold my head I beseech you.' ‘Very much
should Ι like it if you were to retch up your lungs.' Bothe and
Ritschl, offended apparently by this use of vomitus, have proposed
a correction which is no improvement. Weise in his index seems to
explain vomitus in this passage by argenti numeratz'o. Does he mean
‘ disgorge the money‚’ ‘ up with it?'

120. Adulescens] i. e. ‘young man,’ is constantly employed by
dramatists in addressing and describing a person without reference,
at least emphatically, to his age. It is not employed when one
person accosts another ceremoniously, and occasionally, although by
no means uniformly, implies that the person addressed is in a social
position somewhat inferior to that of the speaker. It may thus be
often correctly represented by our phrase ‘my lad‚' ‘my man,' or
‘my friend.’ In like manner puer is the common term applied to
a slave, whatever his age may be; so in French a waiter is called
garcon although he may be old and decrepit, and among ourselves
the same takes place with regard to post-boys. In our early writers
Childe is applied to knights and squires, and in the plays and novels
of the last century clzz'ld is frequently used by ladies when addressing
full-grown women of a lower grade. The following examples of this
use of adulescens will suffice to illustrate what we have said: As. II.
ii. 70, III. iii. 443 Epid. 1. i. 1, III. iv. 4, 8, 23; Men. ΙΙ. ii. 11, 15,
ΙΙΙ. ii. 29, 33, 413 Pers. IV. iv. 108; Poen. V. v. 28; Pseud. ΙΙ. ii.
213 Rud. IV. iii. 43 Trin. IV. ii. 47, 126.

144. ad unum saxum] “Abundat unum,⁰ and on Aul. Ι. ii. 11
“Vox unam pleonastice adiecta ut saepius in Plauto‚'’ says Weise, a
most unsatisfactory explanation, one which ought ever to be regarded
with extreme distrust. There can be no doubt that in the older
forms of the language unus denoted not merely ‘one' with numerical
