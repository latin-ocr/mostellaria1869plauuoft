1 24 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 2 3 (19), Aletuo ne technae meae perpetuo perierint, ‘I am
afraid that my schemes have been and m'll be upset one after another
without a pause;’ and so perpetuo perire signifies the same as perire
in perpetuom modum, ‘to go to destruction headlong;' Pers. II. iv. 10,
Adel. II. iv. 19, Eun. V. iii. 13. The phrase in perpetuom is some-
times equivalent to ‘ always,' and may be used with reference to the
period of a whole life: Heaut. IV. v. 335 Cic. Cat. Ι. 123 Liv. VII.
37. The verb perpeluare occurs once in Plautus, Pseud. I. iii. 72,
lVon est iustus quisquam amator nisi qui perpetuat data, ‘ unless one
who makes presents uninterruptedly‚’ and is found in Cicero also.
For other examples of perpetuus and perpetuo, see Amph. Prol. 6 ς
Poen. I. ii. 82; Pers. ΙΙΙ. i. 2; Eun. V. iv. 11; Adel. V. ix. 15;
And. III. iii. 32; Adel. IV. i. 6; Hec. ΙΙΙ. iii. 46.

64. Cor dolel] i. e. ‘my heart aches,' from which is formed the
substantive cordolium, ‘the beart-ache‚' found twice in Plautus; Cist.
1. i. 67, Poen. I. ii. 86; and revived by Apuleius Met. IX. 190. It
has been adopted into Italian as cordqglio.

68. Dz‘sczpulz'nae aliis eram] i. e. ‘I was a pattem (or model) to
others.’ The original unsymcopated form of the word is here pre-
served in the Palatine MSS. In this passage discipulinae is equiva-
lent to exemplo, ‘I was a model from which others might learn
their duty‚' but it assumes many* shades of meaning, which may
however be easily connected with each other. Thus in As. Ι. iii.
49, eadem disciplina utimur means, ‘we follow the same system ;'
in Cas. ΙΙΙ. v. 24, Atticam disciplinam, ‘the laws and usages of
Athens ;’ and in v. 28, Malarum malam disciplinam, ‘the evil ex-
ample or customs of bad women ;’ in Cist. I. i. 18, disczplina is ‘the
ways and rules of a family ;’ in Bac. I. ii. 27, lua disciplina is exactly
represented by ‘your discipline‚' viz„ that of a teacher towards a
pupil, and so ΙΙΙ. iii. 173 in Mil. II. ii. 30, paret disciplinam, ‘let her
school herself ;’ in Merc. I. 6, haec disciplina, ‘this fashion or custom 3'
in Truc. I. i. 30, ila cst disciplina, ‘thus are matters ordered ;’ in
Ι. ii. 29, ea est disciplina, ‘ so was I trained to be.’

- Parsimonia et duritia discipulinac aliis erana] Dt‘sctpulinae may be
either the genitive after parsimonia and duritia, signifying ‘training,’
in which case the construction will be eram exemplo aliis, or the
dative, eram discipulinae aliis, i. e. ‘I was a lesson to others?

Ι. iii. 9. Periere lzaec oppido aedes] This is the reading of B, which
has hec, and was adopted by Camerarius; the rest of the MSS. have
hae. There can be no doubt however that haec was used occa-
sionally by the older writers as the feminine nom. pl.‚ and it is
