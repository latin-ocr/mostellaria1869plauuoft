METRE AND PROSODY. lxv

[raher into one long syllable. The lines which immediately follow
are confessedly in a mutilated state. At v. 119 a series of Troch.
Tetr. Cat. commence.

The Catalectic Tetrameter is sometimes found subjoined to the

Acatalectic, as in Men. V. vi. 1,
Spectanzen bono servo id est qui rem herilem,

and so on to the end of v. 10.
The following four lines, at the commencement of the fourth scene

of the first Act, are set down by Weise as ‘ Bacchiaci‚’

Advorsum venire mihi ad Philolachem
Volo temperi: audi: hem, libi imperatum est.
Nam illi, ubifui, effugi foras .·
Ita me ibi male convivii sermom'sque laesum est.
The first presents no difficulty if we change venire into veniri and
Philolachem into Philolachetem, pronouncing Philo as one long syl-

lable, Phlo.

In the second line we can make out two Bacchii at the commence-
ment and one at the end, but it is hard to squeeze Ilem tibi imp
into anything‚ unless we avoid elision, contract libi into one long
syllable, and call the result a Molossus.

The third line has confessedly a Catalectic ending, and is mutilated
in the middle.

The fourth line presents us with six short syllables at the begin-
ning, which may be conceived to result from the resolution of a
Molossus, and then follow two Molossi and a Bacchius.

C relic Verses.

The Cretic measure was extensively used by the Roman tragic
and cornic poets. The species generally employed was the Tetra-
meter Acatalectic, but specimens of the Catalectic variety occur here
and there, and Dimeters are not uncommon.

The proper foot‚ as the name implies, is the Pes Creticus (- ψ -)‚
and the following are pure Tetrameters—

Ilia] res fords Ιᾶῦἳίῡν ἰῖᾳῆιϊῡν.

Ne ᾶνόἶίνῐ (ficta nostra ᾶνύἲίνᾶνῐ queant.
Nam doli non doli siin! nisi ᾶςίιῖ coltis.

Sed malam moxomzim. si id polam ρνότέηῑί.
