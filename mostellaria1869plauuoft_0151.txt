METRE AND PROSODY. cvii

Mil. III. i. 66 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Lepidiorem ad omnes res, nec qui amicus amico sil magis‚·
Cist. V. 1 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Quid hoc negoti est quod omnes homines fabulantur per viam,
where quid hoc also is a monosyllable.

Ergo. Autem. Quippe. But although the principle of shortening
certain common words in pronunciation may be fairly admitted in
the words enumerated above, it has been extended to others upon
very feeble and imperfect evidence. Such are ergo, aulem, quippe,
and perhaps some others, but we shall be content with examining
these.

Autem is one of the words which it was held might be pronounced
as a pyrrich, amem, with the first short, as if it were cilem, or
‘ correptim,' that is, as a monosyllable; but although Lindemann
seems to acquiesce in this (Ad Trin. II. ii. 52), he admits else-
where (De Prosodia Pl. p. xxiV.) that only one satisfactory example
can be adduced: Stich. I. iii. 60 (Senan),

Quot potiones mulsi: quot antem prandia,

a reading which is retained by W., who remarks, “Luculentum hoc
exemplum correpti autem ab initio. Cf. et Amph. Prol. 36, Merc. 11.
iii. 85, Mil. ΙΙΙ. i. 84, Pers. V. i. 11.’' There is no doubt that
in the above passage all the MSS„ including A, have aulem,-
Brixius, who is followed by R„ corrects ilem. In Mil. III. i. 84 the
MSS. are corrupt and the reading is very uncertain. In Amph.
Prol. 36, W. has got into confusion, for while in his note he
speaks of autem as pronounced ‘correptim‚’ his text (which is herc
the Vulgate) presents no difficulty-—

Iusta aulem ab iniustis petere insipientia esl,

although he says that petere is not to be elided. In fact, he seems
to have forgotten that the last syllable of aulem is elided before ab.
See his accentuation. Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 85 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Litzgare nolo ego vos, neque tuam aulem accusari fidem,

is another of the examples given by W., but surely the simple way
to scan the line is to sink tuam—

 

Lililgcire Ι nolo &gb Ι vos neffque ΙΙ tu' aul' dclczisdlri sidlt'm.

Nothing can be asserted positivcly as to the measure of Pers. V. i. 1 1.
On the whole, as Lindemann observes, the whole doctrine os aulem,
