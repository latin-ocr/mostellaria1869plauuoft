MAN USCRIPTS OF PLAUTU S. v

numerous ,conjectural emendations carry conviction to our minds,
and have in the great maj0rity of cases been acquiesced in as
certain, or at least acknowledged to be superior to those proceeding
from any other source. Although many of the best scholars of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries busied themselves with Plautus,
and several examined again and again his MSS. with the most
anxious care—among whom we may name Fabricius, Lambinus,
Dousa, Taubmannus, Pareus, Gruterus, and Guyetus—and although
doubtless not a few alterations and improvements were introduced
by these eminent men, still the result of their exertions‚ in com-
parison with those of Camerarius, may be regarded as insignificant,
and the text as presented by him is essentially the same with that
exhibited in the Vulgate or Standard Recension‚ which was worked
up by Gronovius, and appears under its best form in the edition
printed at Leyden in 1684.

[At this point, after remarking that little was done sor our author
during the seventeenth century, the author had intended to insert a
general criticism of the editions of Bothe, Weise, and Ritschl‚ and it
is much to be regretted that this portion of his task‚ like so many
others, was left uncompleted. It will be seen abundantly srom the
critical notes how often and how strongly he dissents srom the arbi-
trary changes introduced into the text by Ritschl‚ and especially those
introduced for supposed metrical reasons.-E1>.]

MANUSCRIPTS OF PLA UTUS.

The most important of the existing manuscripts of Plautus

are—-
A. The lean Palimpsest.

This MS. was transferred from the celebrated monastery of
St. Columbanus at Bobbio to the Ambrosian Library about the
beginning of the seventeenth century. An account of it was first
published by Angelo Mai, in 1815, in his “ M. Accii Plaulz‘ frag-
menta inedz'ta,’' and it has since been carefully scrutinized by Ritschl‚
Schwartzmann, and others. The original writing was believed by
Mai to belong to the age os the Antonines‚ but may with greater
probability be ascribed to the fifth or sixth century, and it must
be regarded as one os the oldest, if not the very oldest, specimen
in existence os any Latin classical author. The superimposed writing
belongs to the ninth century, and consists of a portion of the Old
