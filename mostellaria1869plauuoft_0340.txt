1 58 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

emere. Lucilius lib. XXVII: facio, ad lenonem venio, tribus in
libertatem milibus Destz'ner.'' Cic. Epp. Fam. VII. xxiii. § 3, when
speaking of the purchase of several works os art, Quod libi destinaras
τραπεζοφόρον, si le delectat, habebis ,· sin autem sententiam mutasti, ego
habebo scilicet. Plautus uses also the verb Praestino, manifestly con·
nected with the same root as Destino, in the sense of ‘to purchase.’
Thus Paul. Diae. p. 233, ed. Mull„ “Praeslz'nare apud Plautum prae-
emere est, id est emendo tenere ;” thus Capt. IV. ii. 66, Iuben an non
iubes astitui aulas κ’ palinas elui? Laridum alque c’pulasfhverzficulzlrflr·
ventibus Β Alium pisces praestinatum abire ,Ρ Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 90, E. Quasi
tu cupias liberare fidicinam animi gralia, Quasique ames vehementer lu
illam. P. Quam ad rem isluc refert.) E. Rogas Β Vt enim praestines
argento, priusquam venial filius ,· Pseud. I. ii. 36, Ego eo in macellum
ul piscium quidquid esl prelio praestarem. The word seems to occur
in no other author until it was revived by Apuleius, who employs
it repeatedly: Met. I. 5, 24, IV. 15, VII. 9, VIII. 23, 24, IX. 6, 105
Apol. 101. See note of Hildebrand on VII. 9.

111. arraboni] See also III. iii. 15 (IV. ii. 15), IV. iii. 21 (iv. 21).
The word arrabo, which appears also under the shape of arra, is taken
directly from the Greek α’ῤῥαβὼν, which again is taken from a Hebrew
verb signisying ‘to promise‚’ ‘to become security.' Both words are
frequently found written with an aspirate arrha and arrhabo, but
these forms probably belong to a period of the language subsequent
to the age of Plautus. Technically an arrabo was a partial payment
made by a purchaser when he concluded a bargain, in security that he
would not repudiate his engagement. The French word les arrhes is
identical in meaning, and in Scotland the earnest—penny given to a
servant when hired is called tlte arlcs. Thus Rud. Prol. 45, Mirus- tri-
ginta sibi puellam destinat Dalque arrabonem el iureiurando adlegan· and
so again, in reference to the same transaction‚ II. vi. 71, ΙΙΙ. vi. 23,
from which it is evident that when a seller received an arrabo he was
bound to abide by his bargain. In Poen. V. vi. 22 it is used more
loosely to denote an object seized as security or compensation for
a debt, Leno arrabonem hoc pro mina mecum fi’ro ,· and in Heaut. ΙΙΙ.
iii. 42 an object (a girl) lest as security sor money borrowed, Ea
(sc. filia adulescentula) relicta huic arraboni est pro illo argento. In
Mil. IV. i. 11 it is used figuratively: Palaestrio, presenting a ring to
the soldier, says, Hunc arrabonem amoris primum a me accipe ,· and in
Truc. ΙΙΙ. ii. 22 there is an elaborate joke in consequence of a slave
having by design or accident said rabonem instead of arrabonem .-
