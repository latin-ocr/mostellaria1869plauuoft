transposing tui and omitting miserum, which will make all smooth.
Moreover, it will be found that much confusion prevails in this por-
tion of the scene, and that various violent changes and transpositions
are necessary in order to maintain the system in its integrity. Hence
obviously we may pronounce that there is in reality no authority for
satellites. In Weise's text we find the reading of the MSS„ and he

calls the line a Troeh. Tetr. Cat., but how he proposes to scan it
Ι cannot tell.

The word supellex in the nominative occurs in Aul. II. v. 17,
Men. II. iii. 53, V. ix. 96, Pers. IV. viii. 2, Poen. V. iii. 27, in all
of which we may adhere to the quantity of supellex, as found in
Virgil, Propertius, Horace, and Juvenal, although some of the MSS.
and earlier editions, including the Vulgate, uniformly write szqopellcx.
But two passages, in which the word appears in oblique caseS,
present a difficulty. In Poen. V. iii. 26 (Senar.) we have—

T ace alque parce muliebri supellectili,-
and in Stich. Ι. ii. 5 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Iam quzdem in suo quidque loco nz'sz' erit mz'lzz‘ situm supelleclt'lts,

where the Palimpsest and the Vet. Cod. Camer. have quicque,- the
Cod. Decurt. and the best Vatic.‚ quique ‚· the Cod. Lips.‚ quoque ,-
the Ed. Princ., quaeque,· the Cod. Lips.‚ sila,· the Palimps, the Cod.
Lips.‚ and the Ed. Princ., supellectz'lis,· the two Pall. and the Vat.‚
suppelleclz'lzs. Mooeover, Festus (p. 294) and other grammarians
recognise supellectiles as a form of the nominative.

This being premised, if the two lines as given above exhibit the
genuine text, then the word supellectilis must undergo some modi-
fication. According to the views of R. it will belong to the same
category as that in which he has placed expapillato and satellites,
and may be scanned as supellectilum· a less violent mode of eseaping
from the difficulty would be to sink the second syllable and to pro-
nounce supleclz'lis. But neither expedient is necessary. As to the
first example (Poen. V. iii. 26), we may avoid all embarrassment
by a simple transposition—

Tace alque muliebri parce supelleclz'lz',·

in the second (Stich. I. ii. 5), the rhythm of which is so harsh that
R. proposes to re-write the line, we may, without violence to the MSS„
consider supellectz‘lzs as a nominative, and write—

Iam quidem in suo quaeque loco nz'sae' erit mihi sita supellectiles,

the corruption having in all probability originated in some early
