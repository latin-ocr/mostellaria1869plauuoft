1 3 2 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Pseud. 1. i. 99. Observe that in Mil. II. vi. 35, postulare tecum sig-
nifies ‘to complain of you‚' ‘to accuse you;' and so postulatio, Cas.
III. ii. 26. See also Bac. ΙΙΙ. iii. 38, 45.

104. Purpurissum] ‘ Rouge.' It was made by boiling fine chalk
with the purple dye obtained from the murex. Plin. H. N. XXXV.
6, ξ 26, Ε reliquis coloribus quos a domz'm's dari dz'ximcs propter mag-
nitudinem preti ante omnes est purpurissum. Creta argentaria cum
purpuris pariter unguitur bibitque eum colorem celerius lanis. Cf.
XXXV. 6, ξ 12. The form purpurisso is quoted by Non. p. 218,
from the Sanniones of Naevius, Inlino cretam, cerussam, purpurissum.
Plautus uses also the participial adjective pur-purtssalus, Truc. II. i.
3 5, Quia adeo fores nostras unguentes uncta es ausa accedere, Quiaque
istas buccas tam belle purpurissatas habes.

105. Interpolare] This verb is found only in the form of a
compound, but we can scarcely doubt that the simple polo is derived
from the same root as polio, The true meaning of the word seems
to be ‘to renovate,’ ‘ to furbish up‚' ‘to change the appearance os an
object,’ the idea being usually implied that this is effected by the
addition of something which enters into combination with the original
object. It is said to have been properly a term describing the
operations performed by fullones in cleaning woollen garments, and
this explanation is supported by a passage in Cic. Epp. ad Q. F. II.
xii. 2, when speaking of Antiochus of Commagene; Quod vult, in-
quam, renovare honores eosdem, quominus togam praetextam quotannis
interpolet, decernendum nihil cense0, i. e. ‘to save him from furbishing
up his old toga praetexta ever year.'* Vestimenta interpola in the
Digest XVIII. 1, ᾧ 45 are opposed to nova. Cf. XXI. i. 37.
Hence it signifies ‘to clean' simply, without the notiori of adding
anything, as in Plin. H. N. XII. 14, ξ 32, At, Hercules, Alexandriae,
ubi tura interpolantur. The meaning of the expression in Aul. IV.
ix. 6 is very doubtful. Of the word used in the general or figurative
sense of ‘to invest an object with a new aspect‚' we have a good
example in Amph. Ι. i. 160, where Mercury, addressing his own
clenched fist, observes, Alia forma oportet esse, quem tu pugno legerzls;
to which Sosia rejoins, Illic homo me interpolabit, meumque os finget
denuo,· and in Cic. in Verr. Act. II. i. 61, ξ 158, Hoc modo iste sibi et
saluti suae prospicere duaa, referendo in tabulas et privatas el publicas

* It is well known that togae were cleaned and whitened by rubbing in
chalk or pipe-clay3 hence the phrases (Livy IV. 2 5) album in vestimentum
addere petionis . . . causa, and (Pers. V. 177) cretata ambitio. Compare
Plin. H.N. XXXV. 17 ξ 57.
