NOTES. 1. ii. 64—iii. 14. 125

evident that it was much more likely to be changed by transcribers
into the common form hae than the reverse. Thus in Aul. III. v. 58,
Haec sunt atque aliae multae in magnis dotibus Incommodzyates sump-
tusque intolerabiles, is the reading of the best MSS. and is retained
in the Vulg.; so Eun. III. v. 34, Abducit secum ancillas: paucae, quae
circum illam essent, manent Novitiae puellae: continuo haec adornant ut
lavet, where the reading is, apparently, not disputed; so also Phor. ‚
V. viii. 23, where however the reading is doubtful; so istaec, nom.
pl. fem. (=istae haec); Hec. IV. ii. 17, S. Nihil pol iam istaec res
mihi voluptatis jerunt.

11. meo ocello] ‘the apple of my eye.y Catullus employs the same
term when addressing his beloved Sirmio, Penz‘nsularmn, Sirmio,
insularumque Ocelle. For a collection of terms of endearment see
Excursus.

14. sapit scelesta multum] ‘the cunning jade is very knowing.'
Scelestus in the dramatists bears two significations, which must be
kept distinct. 1. It is used in the strict literal sense of villainous;
thus below, ΙΙ. ii. 72 (71), scelestus, auri causa, ‘the villain (did it)
for the sake of gold ;’ and vituperatively‚ below, v. 26, Quid ais,
scelesta, ‘what's that you say, you wretch?' and Rud. IV. i. 4, Sed
uxor scelesta, ‘ but that jade, my wife‚' where Weise is quite mistaken.
In this sense the epithet may be applied to things as well as persons,
as in the line immediately following the one quoted above, Scelestae
hae sunt aedes, ‘ guilt attaches to this mansion 3' and in III. i. 1, Sce-
· lestiorem ego annum, &c., ‘never did 1 see a more villainous year for
lending out money ;’ and this use of villainous is common in our own
language. Scelestus is also employed to denote craft or subtlety
rather than actual guilt, as in Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 126, etsi scelestus est At mi
infidelis non est, ‘although the fellow is a cunning rogue, yet he is
not unfaithful to me;’ it is used also playfully, as in the line before
us, and so sceleste, Most. II. ii. 47, where the reading is doubtful, means
‘you rascal,' but without any serious emphasis. 2. As if to indicate
the due connection between crime and misery, scelestus passes into
the sense of mz'serable, and is used without necessarily implying guilt
at all, in the sense of ‘ unhappy' or ‘unfortunate' So below, III. i. 36
(33), nae ego sum miser, Scelestus, natus dis inimicis omnibus. One who
was unlucky or unfortunate might be regarded as punished by the
gods for some crime; and this seems to be indicated in the above
passage, and also in Capt. 111.v. 104, Eun. II. iii. 34, and As. V.
ii. 6, At scelesta ego praeter alios meum virum fui rata Siccum, frugi,
continentem, amantem uxoris maxume, ‘ wretched beyond others ;'
