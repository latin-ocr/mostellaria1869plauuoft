several of these cannot be scanned without conjectural emendations
more or less violent—

v. 94. Molossus followed by two Bacchii, but unless we pronounce
the word congrediar as a trisyllable, and regard the line as Catalectic,
we must have recourse to some such conjectural emendation as
that proposed by W. and R„ who read congredz'bor.

v. 95. Molossus in 1st.

v. 96. As it stands the line is Catalectic, but the MSS. are in

v. 108. Molossus in 1st. Philolacheti pronounced Phl5lachet1'.

v. 109. Pure. There is an hiatus between sibi and haud, but
