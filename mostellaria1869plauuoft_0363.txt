EXCVRsvs 1.—ADEO. 179

endeavour to show that the whole can, without violence, be arranged
under one or other of the above three heads.

Ι. Adeo equivalent to ad ea, praeterea, ‘in additi0n‚' ‘besides,'
‘ moreover,' ι31503>1Ι< Rud. IV. iv. 122, Qui te Di omnes perdant, qui
me hodie oculis vidisti tuis, llquue adeo scelestum qui non circumspexi
centies, i. e. ‘and me also ;’ Amph. II. ii. 44, Amphitruo uxorem
salutat laetus speratam suam, Quam omnium Thebis vir unam esse
optumam diiudicat, Quamque adeo cives Thebani vero rumzficant pro-
bam, i. e. ‘ and whom the citizens of Thebes also ;’ Eun. Ι. ii. 124, Et
quidquid huius feci, causa virginis Feci: nam me eius spero fratrem
propemodum Iam repperisse, adulescentem adeo nobilem, i. e. ‘ for I
hope that Ι have discovered her brother, a young man moreover of
good family;’ Andr. III. iii. 47, Tute adeo iam eius verba audies,
‘and you yourself moreover,’ ‘more than that, you with your own
ears shall hear his wordsg'† Hec. II. i. 42, Tuos esse ego illi mores
morbum magis quam ullam aliam rem arbitror Et merito adeo, nam, &c.‚
i. e. ‘ and with good reason too.’ Such seems to be the force of adeo
in a fragment of the Medea Exsul of Ennius, quoted by Probus on
Virg. Ecl. VI. 31, Iuppiter, tuque adeo summe Sol, qui omnes res inspicis,
i. e. ‘thou Jove, and thou also Sol, high above all;' and in the invo-
cation at the beginning of the first Georgic‚ where the poet, after
addressing the gods of the sky, of earth, and of ocean, turns his
prayer to Caesar (v. 24), Tuque adeo quem mox, ‘and on thee also
do I call] We may, perhaps, place under the same head, Virg. Ecl.
IV. 11, Teque adeo, decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit, Pollio: et incipient
magni procedere menses, i.e. ‘ and in addition to all the other propitious
combinations of this happy epoch, the boy will enter upon his career
in thy consulship, O Pollio: &c. Virg. Ecl. II. 25 is more doubtful ;
Nec sum adeo informis, which we may translate, ‘and besides, Ι am
by no means unshapely,' but we may refer this example to the next
Section, an ellipse being implied, ‘and Iam not so (to such an extent)
ugly (as to make me repulsive).’

II. Adeo equivalent to ‘up to that point or limit,' ‘to that (such a)
degree or extent‚' ‘to that (such a) pitch or pass,’ meanings, as

* Freund says that adeo occurs in this sense in the comic writers only.
He quotes two examples—Pseud. 1. ii. 80, where, according to rny vieW, it
signifies ‘thus,' ‘in this way,’ and Most. III. i. 101 (97), where, whatever
it may denote, it cannot possibly mean ad haec or praeterea. See note
on the passage. lt will appear from the quotations which we shall give
that adeo in this sense is found not only in the comic writers, but in the
tragedies of Ennius and in Virgil.

† Here Donatus says “ παρέλκεται adeo, modo et abundat.”
