politely‚ ‘unless your opinion is in aught at variance with mine,' to
which Periphanes replies, ‘ no, (Ι do not differ from you, on the con-

trary) you have contrived cleverly.'
Imo si scias is a combination in which imo is said to have some-

times the force of ‘yes’ used as a direct affirmative.⁴ But if we
examine carefully the passages referred to, it will be found that they
have not been interpreted correctly: thus Eun. II. iii. 61, Parmeno
is describing to Chaerea the gift presented to Thais, C. Quis is est
tam potens cum tanto munere hoc:> P. llliles Thraso Phaedriae rivalis.
C. Duras fratrtlr partes praedicas. P. Imo enim si scias quod donum
huic dono contra comparet, Tum magis id dicas : C. ‘According to what
you state my brother has a hard part to play.' P. ‘No, no, (it is
too soon for you to speak of that, what I have mentioned is a
mere trifle‚) for if you were to know what gift your brother is

providing in opposition to this gift, you would have better grounds
for saying so! ‘Yes’ is, at first sight, the natural translation of
imo in this passage, but enim is introduced to explain why Parmeno
says ‘no’ when ‘yes' might have been expected. Exactly similar
is Heaut. ΙΙΙ. iii. 38, S. Pessuma haec est meretrix. C. Ita videtur.
S. Imo si scz'as. Vah! vide quod inceptet facinus, ‘ nay, (it would be
time enough for you to say so,) if you were to know all ;’ and
again, IV. v. 22, C. Probe. S. Dic sodes. C. lVimium inquam.
S. Imo si scias, Sed porro ausculta quod superest fallaciae, ‘nay, (not
so fast, say not so yet‚) if you were to know all (you might say so),
but listen,’ &o

The following passage from the Andria, IV. ii. 2 5, presents con-

siderable difficulty, and is quoted as an example of imo signifying
plain ‘yes.’ Davus having announced to Pamphilus and Charinus

that he had hit upon a scheme which would extricate the former from

his embarrassments, Pamphilus asks (v. 22), P. Quidsaciess' cedo.
D. Dies mihi hic ut sit satis vereor Ad agendum .· ne vacuom esse me

nunc ad narrandum credas, Proinde lzinc vos amolimini: nam mihi
impedimento estis. P. Ego lzanc visam. D. Quid lu ,ν’ Quo hinc te agis τ’
C. Verum vis· dicam ,ν’ O. Imo etiam lVarrationis incipit mihi initium.
C. Quid me fiet Ρ It will be scen that Davus declares that he has so
much to do that he has no time for explanations, and tells the young
men to take themselves off, as they are in his way. On this Pam-
philus says that he will go and pay a visit to Glycerium; Charinus
lingers, and Davus turning to him sharply asks, ‘ and whither are you
going ?’ Charinus, instead of making a short direct reply, asks, Verum
ris dicam. Davus from these words anticipates that the young man
