been comprehended by grammarians under the general title of
Poetical Licences. Without stopping to inquire into the strict pro-
priety of this term, we should expect that all the ‘licences' found
in the epic and lyric poets would present themselves in the dra-
matists, and we need feel no surprise is they exceed those of the
later writers both in number and boldness.

1. The letter J. Since the character i was employed to denote
both a vowel and also a consonant, which, it is probable, had the
sound of an English y, the Augustan poets permitted themselves
occasionally to give it the force of a consonant in certain words in
which it properly represented a vowel. Thus the words, abietibus,
parietibus, which as quinquesyllables, with the first four short, would
be inadmissible in Dactylic verse, were pronounced and scanned
as quadrisyllables, abjetibus, parjetibus, the first syllable being now
made long by position. So also, without the plea of absolute
necessity, we find fluvyorum, αῷνεὲηαε, as trisyllables‚ and such
combinations as consily’et (for consilium et), principy'huc (for prin-
cipium huc), and a few others.

In the same way in Plautus we have such contractioris as
