ORTHOGRAPHY. xlix'

Some forms of orthography seem to have been adopted by the very
earliest Roman writers, which, like the duplication of the vowel, passed
away at once: thus Priscian, p. 556, tells us on the authority of
Varro, “ de origine Linguae Latinae,” that the “ vetustissimi auctores
Romanorum ” wrote Agchzlves, agceps‚ aggulus, aggeus, agngla, igge-
runt, for Anchises, anceps, angulus, angens, anguilla, zbzgerunt, as the
Greeks wrote ἅγγελος, Ἀγχίσης; see also p. 569, and Mar. Victorin.

pp. 2462, 2465.
