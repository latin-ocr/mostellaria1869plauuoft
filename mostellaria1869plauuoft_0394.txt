ΙΙ. Enim. Enim is more common under such circumstances, and
this use of the word has, in very many cases, been overlooked by
commentators, who, in such examples as those which follow, assert
that enim is equivalent to enim vero, assuming that enim vero is equi-
valent to the simple ver0, and may signify merely ‘ truly’ or ‘ indeed‚'
being little better than an expletive. But we maintain that in the
earlier writers enim vero always signifies ‘ for in truth‚' as enim always
signifies ‘ for,' and that both are uniformly employed to introduce an
explanation. Frequently the blank is very easily supplied, an affirma-
tion or negation only being suppressed: thus Pers. II. v. 16, S. Quia
boves bini hic sunt in crumena. T. Emitte sodes, ne enices same, sine
ire pastum. S. Enim metuo ut possim in bubilem reicere ne vagentur,
‘nay, not so, for Ι am afraid that I shall not be able to drive them
back again to their stall, and that they will stray;' Most. III. iii. 23
(IV. ii. 23), T R. Quia tibi umquam quicquam, postquam tuus sum, ver-
borum dedi! Τη. Ego enim cavi recte, ‘ no, you have not, sor Ι have
been well on my guard!

Sometimes the suppressed clause is less simple, but, in general, it
may be very easily deduced from the context: thus Epid. V. i. 41,
S. Acczspe argentum hoc, Dam'sta .· hic sunt quadraginta minae, Si quid
erit dubium znmutabo. D. Benefecz'sti: bene vale. S. Nunc enim tu
mea es: here, in all probability, the enim is explanatory of an action
or gesture—Stratippocles having paid the money proceeds to lay
hold of the slave whom he had purchased, and upon her shrinking
back he exclaims, ‘I have a right to take possession of you, sor you
are now my property 3' Bac. IV. iv. 51, M. [Vunc quidnos visfaceret'
C. Enim m'hz'l, nisi ut ametis inpero .· ‘Now what do you want us to
do ?' ‘ Be easy as to that, for Ι bid you do nothing except’ &c Cas.
ΙΙ. ἰν. 1, S. Qui illum Di omnes Deaeque perdant! C. Te uxor aiebat
tua Me vocare. S. Ego enim vocari iussi, ‘she said truly‚ for Ι ordered
you to be called3' Pers. IV. iv. 59, Τ. Sequere me: adduco hanc, si
quid vis ex lzac percontarier. D. Enim volo te adesse, ‘ by all means
will I question her now, for I wish you to be present3' Most. V. ii.
11 (iii. 11), T ll. Verbera, etiam inrides? Τ R. Quian' me pro te ire ad
cenam autumo ,θ T H. Non enim ibis, ego serare sax0, ut meruisti, in
crucem, ‘you need say nothing about going to supper, you shall not
