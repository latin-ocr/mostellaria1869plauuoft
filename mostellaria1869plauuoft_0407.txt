EXCVRSVS V111.-Q VIN. 2 ι 9

Iwill not only scare his father from entering the house, but, more
than that, that I will deal with him in such a manner that he m‘ll
not venture even to look at it, but’ «Sec. 3 so Men. V. ii. 55, S. Male
fizcz'l, si istuc facil ; si non facil, lu malefacis, Quae zbesonlem insimules.
M. Quin eliam nunc habel pallam paler, Et spinther, quod ad hanc
delulerat: nunc, quia rescivi, refert, i. e. ‘ not only do I not falsely ac-
cuse him of having carried off my property, but, more than that, at this
very time he has in his possession a dress and a broach,’ &c., where,
however, etiam may, if we please, be connected with nunc. We have
the expression still more fully in Eun. IV. iii. 3, Quin eliam insuper
scelus, διε.

The form of quin in the following passages may be conveyed by
the words ‘well' or ‘nay,' ‘for that matter, assuredly,' and it serves
to introduce an explanation of the feelings or actions of the speaker:
Adel. IV. vii. 14, after Demea has reproached his brother for his
indifference and indulgence in the matter of Aeschinus and Pam-
phila, Micio asks—M. Quz'clsltcz'am amplius ,θ D. Qm'dface'as? si non
zpsa re istuc tibi dolel, Simulare cerle est hominis. M. Quin iam vir-
ginem Despondz' .· rcs composita esl .· fiunt nuptiae: Dempsz‘ melum
omnem .· haec magis sunl homz'm's, ‘ nay, for that matter, (in so sar as
my duty as a right-minded man is concerned,) I have already settled
the marriage of the maiden with my son; the affair is arranged; the
wedding is in progress:' here quin introduces an explanation and
conveys, perhaps, a tone of indignation, ‘ why I tell you ;’ Andr. IV.
ii. 20, P. Scio quid conere. D. Hoc ego tibi profecto effectum reddam.
P. Iam hoc opus esl. D. Quintam habeo. C. Quid este ‘well‚ then,
for that matter, I have already a scheme5' Heaut. IV. iii. 23, Clinia
is discussing with Syrus how the real state of affairs may best be
concealed from his father—C. A'am quo ore appellabo patrem ,θ Tenes
quid dicam ,Ρ S. Quidni? C. Quid dicam? quam causam acffi’rame'
S. Quin, nolo mentiare. Aperle‚ ila ul res sese habel, narralo, ‘ nay, for
that matter, I do not want you to tell a lie,' ‘do not suppose that I
want you :¹ here quin is explanatory, as Syrus wishes to guard against
a misapprehension; Merc. III. iv. 43, C. Deos apsenles lesles me-
moras: qui ego z'sluc credam tibi? E. Quin tibi z'n manu esl, quod
credas : ego quod dicam id mihi mea in manu est, ‘ well, for that matter,
you have the power of believing what you please; I have the power
of saying what 1 please;⁷ Most. 111. i. 86 (82), Vide, num moratur ,θ
D. Quin seram, si quid datur, ‘nay, for that matter‚’ or ‘ assuredly,
you may be sure of this, that' &c.; Heaut. V. i. 71, Id mirari le

simulam, el illum hoc rogitato shnu? Quamobrem id fact'am. M. Quin
