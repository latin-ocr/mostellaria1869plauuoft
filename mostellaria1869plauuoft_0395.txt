gibbet;’ so v. 23, T H. Maxume accipito hanc ad le litem. Τ R. Enz'm
z’slz‘c captio est, ‘by no means' or ‘no‚ I thank you, for there is a
trick in that 3' and the same words are repeated in Epid. V. ii. 36 ;
Men. ΙΙ. i. 25, Mm. Molestus ne sis: non luo hoc fiel modo. illus. Hem,

L. Enim me nominat. C. Familiam optumam obcupavz't. L. Quid ego
cesso hos conloqui? Lysiteles has not yet shown himself, but is listening

‘indeed' or ‘truly;’ Most. III. i. 24 (20), Tranio having heard, to
