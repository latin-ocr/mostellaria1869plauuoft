A. P. 319, morataque recte Fabula, is correctly explained by the old
commentator, “in qua mores singularum personarum optime ex-
primuntur.''

accomplished and attractive female slave seems to have varied from
20 to 60 minae. Thus Stratippocles, Epid. 1. i. 50, is represented
as having paid 40 minae for a beautiful captive girl; in the Cure. I.
i. 63, Phaedromus complains of the leno who was the proprietor of
Planesium, Alias me poscit pro illa triginta minas Alias talentum
magnum. He at one time asks 30 minae, at another 60, and in II.
iii. 65 she is represented as having been sold for 30, with the addition
of 10 for her apparel and ornaments. In Merc. II. iii. 93, 20 minae
are spoken of as a reasonable price for a handsome female slave,
and 30 minae were paid by Philolaches for Philematium, and by
Pleusidippus for Palaestra, Rud. Prol. 45. The same price was fixed
for the attractive Pamphila in the Phormio, III. iii. 24. In Pseud.
Ι. i. 51, iii. 110, Phoenicium is represented as having been sold
for 20 minae; and in Adel. II. i. 37, IV. vii. 34, 20 minae is the
price paid by a leno for a psaltria. In Pers. IV. iv. 113, a maiden
believed by the purchaser to be a slave is sold without a warranty
for 60 minae, the seller having at first asked 100: Tuo periculo sex-
aginta lzaec datur argenti mz'ne's. In Poen. IV. ii. 7 5, two little girls,
one five, the other four years old, were sold to a dealer by a Sicilian
pirate for⁰18 minae (it seems doubtful whether the nutrix who was
sold along with them was included in the above suni). Phaedria tells
Thais, Eun. Ι. ii. 89, that he gave 20 minae sor a little black girl
(ex Aethiopia ancillulam) and an eunuch, both of which he had pre-
sented to her. As to men, Hegio (Cap. ΙΙ. ii. 103, iii. 4, 20) values
Philocrates, whom he regards as a young able-bodied slave, at 20
minae; and in the same play we are told that a little boy was kid-
napped when four years old and sold for 6 minae (Cap. V. ii. 21,
iii. 2, iv. 15). In the As. (Ι. ἱίἰ. 77, ΙΙ. ii. 97) Cleaereta agrees to
make over her daughter Philenium to Argyrippus exclusively for one
year (hunc annum) for 20 minae.
