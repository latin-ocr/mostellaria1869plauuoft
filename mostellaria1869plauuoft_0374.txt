1 90 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

pacto, nz'l eliam scio, *Ι will not shrink from my engagement, and (yet
with reference to) that which at this present moment I know will as-
suredly come to pass, I do not know at this present moment (as yet)
how I shall bring it about! Such seems to be the meaning of this
difficult passage. The first of the two lines appears under a different
form in almost every different edition. We have inserted quod, with-
out which the line cannot be scanned, but in other respects have
adhered to the best MSS„ which do not exhibit any variation.

2. ‘Even now’ with a negative, ‘as yet‚' ‘up to this time ;’ Pers. 1.
iii. 48, Numquam edepol quoiquam eliam utendam dedi, ‘ never as yet,'
‘never up to this time have I’ &c.; II. ii. 49, Sophoclidisca says to
the boy Paegnium, Tu quidem haud eliam es octoginta pondo, ‘not yet do
you weigh six stones ;’ IV. iv. 4, Toxilus having asked Dordalus is he
had not been struck by the wis-(lom displayed by the maiden as soon
as she opened her mouth, the leno replies coolly, Haud potui etiam
in primo verbo perspicere sapt'enlzhm, ‘I have not been able as yet, on
hearing the first word she uttered, clearly to discern her wisdom!
Sometimes, to make the meaning more clear and emphatic, adhuc is
added: thus Amph. 1. i. 92, ll'umquam eliam quicquam adhuc verborum
est prolocutus perperam, ‘not one word even now (as yet) up to the
present moment has he uttered contrary to truth.’

3. “Even now,’ implying that an action is continued without inter-
ruption. This is distinctly expressed in Amph. 11. i. 21, Rogasne,
improbe, eliam qui ludos sacis me ,ν’ ‘ you who are even now (still)
making game of me,' ‘continuing to make game of me ;’ in Ι. i. 213,
Mercury says to Sosia, At menlirz‘s ellam, ‘you are lying even now‚'
‘you are continuing to tel] falsehoods,’ having previously said compo-
sz'lt's mendaciis ‹zdvcm'stl; As. V. ii. 73, At sliam cuba! cuculus J Surge,
amator, ι’ domum. ‘but that old cuckoo is even now (still) roosting
there.’ ‘is continuing to roost there;’ Cas. ΙΙ. vi. 16, Iam dudum,
hercle, fabulor. C. Pol lu quidem, alque eliam sacis, ‘I have been
prating here ever so long.’ ‘There‘s no mistake about that, and you
are doing so even nou-‚⁷ ‘you are continuing to prate ;' Bac. IV. iv.
93, M. Laqucre porr0. C. Adscribe dum. M. Ellam loquere, where
ellam loquere is the same as l0q1ccrep0rr0, ‘go οη] ⁴ continue.y Other
examples of elsam in this sense may be found in Amph. I. i. 225; As.
11. ii. 613 Capt. III. iv. 24; Curc. I. iii. 403 Men. IV. iii. 23, V. i. 10;
Merc. IV. iv. 23; Mil. ΙΙΙ. i. 45; Pers. V. ii. 46; Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 171.

Ellam implies addition in such combinations as the ¹following:
