to think that‚' it indicates strong indignation. In this and in many
other cases, where satin and satin ut occur, Weise considers that they
may be expressed by the simple nonne; but it will be found upon ex-
amination that in many places nonne would very inadequately express
the force, and in others it is altogether out of place. Lasssy, we have
satt'n sz',· thus Rud. IV. v. 3, Satin, sz' quoi homini dei esse benefactum
volunt Aliquo illud pacto optingit optatum pits:> i. e. ‘is it not manifest
that if the godS,' &c.; while in Pseud. Ι. i. 110, Satin est si hanc
hodie mulierem efficio tibi Tua ut site i. e. ‘ are you content if?

Ι. ii. 2. Argumenta] Argumentum is properly (see note on Ι. i. 2)
‘something which pierces and carries conviction with it‚’ hence ‘ a
proof‚' hence ‘reasoning,' hence ‘a discussion’ or ‘dissertation’ in
which argumenta are adduced, and hence the ‘subject or theme of a
discussion or dissertation.' It is from the idea of movement implied
in reasons which ‘pierce and carry conviction with them‚' that in is
here followed by pectus in the accusative: ‘ I have raised discussions
and adduced proofs which might penetrate into my breast.' To say,
with Lambinus, that in pectus is put for in pectore “ antiquo more,'' is
little better than an attempt to conceal ignorance. Observe that in
the following line we have in corde not in cor,· after the discussions,
reasonffigs, and proofs had made their way into his breast‚ he then
turned them over and arranged them “z'n corde.’' In v. 9, Ei rei
argumenta dicam means, ‘ I xw'll adduce proofs of what I assert‚’ and
so vv. 15, 37, while in v. 9 we have the same meaning expressed by ad
with the accusative, Auscultate argumenta dum dz‘co ad hanc rem. In
Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 121 we find nearly the same words, Ei rez' argumentum
dicam, which there signffy, ‘I will prove to you that you ought to
follow my advice ς’ and in Truc. I. ii. 68, Amator sz'nzz'ltlr est oppidi
hostilis. D. Quo argumento est :³ ‘How do you make that out ?' ‘How
do you prove that?’ The transition is easy from a dtlrcusst'on to the
