EXCVRSVS X111.—SODES, SIS pl. SVLTIS, (stc. 237

seen by referring to Heaut. IV. iv. 16, Hec. V. i. 27. In Horace,
S. Ι. ix. 41, although the imperative is not expressed it is implied
from the preceding clause.

ΙΙ. Sz's and Sullz’s stand for si vis and si vullis: see passages
frorn Cicero and Festus quoted under sodes. We find sis, although
rarely, in the uncontracted form: thus Adel. II. i. 30, Si salis iam
debacchatus es, leno, audi, εἰ vis, nunc iam, &c.

Sis is generally subjoined to an imperative, and is frequently
connected with it so closely that the two words were, probably, in
the more familiar combinations, pronounced as one, and are so
printed: thus we find videsis, caveris, apagesc's, αόιζςιζτ, and the like.
Sis however is occasionally separated from its imperative by a word:
thus, Cas. ΙΙ. vi. 27, Accipe hanc sis ,· and sometimes placed before
the imperative, as Pers. IV. iv. 104, Ne, sis, plora, and V. ii. 15, Ne
sis me uno degrz‘to attigeri&

According to the circumstances under which it is employed, and
to the tone of voice in which it is uttered, sz's may express feelings os
a varied description, just as the words ‘if you please,' ‘I’ll thank you,'
‘ I’ll trouble you‚’ in English, may express a civil request, a peremp-
tory command, anger, scorn, contempt, and many other emotions.

Thus it denotes ordinary conventional civility in Cas. ΙΙΙ. vi. 20,
II. vi. 27, Epid. III. iv. 39, Merc. III. i. 45, Pers. Π. v. 20, IV. iv.
58, Pseud. III. ii. 50, Rud. ΙΙ. vii. 18: advice, warning‚ reproof,
Pseud. Ι. i. 46, vide sis quam lu rem geras, ‘ you had better take care
what you are about;’ Cure. IV. ii. 35, sac sz's bonae fiwc'gz' sz'eS, ‘see
now that you behave like a good gir13’ Cas. ΙΙ. ii. 31, tace sis, ‘hold
your tongue, will you;' so Epid. V. ii. 3, Pers. II. v. 15, ΙΙΙ. i. 61,
V. ii. 54, Poen. III. v. 16: threat, Pers. V. ii. 15, Ne sz's me uno dtgz'lo
attigeris, ne te ad terram, scelus, afflzgam, ‘you'd better not lay a
single finger upon me ;’ Trin. IV. i. 19, Apage me sis, ‘keep clear of
me, if you please ;' and so Cure. V. iii. 9 : angry command to a slave,
Cas. IV. ii. 14: anger, impatience‚ Poen. Ι. ii. 162, Stich. Ι. i. 36:
a sneer, Truc. IV. iii. 3 5, Vide sis facinus muliebre, ‘ there's a woman's
trick for youl’ and so Adel. V. i. 4: contempt, scorn, Merc. Ι. 57,
Pseud. ΙΙΙ. ii. 102: insolent tone, Pers. III. iii. 8, 9, 17, 32, Acczpe
sz's argentum, Tene sis argentum, Cedo sis mz'lu' argentum, Cape hoc sis,
‘take the money, confound youl’ so Merc. IV. iv. 37: deprecatory
tone, Merc. ΙΙ. ii. 49, Pseud. I. iii. 10: wonder, Pers. IV. iv. 45:
coaxing tone, Pers. V. i. 12, Truc. II. vi. 44: triumph, Epid. 111. ii.
9: eagerness, Poen. III. iv. 3: bitterness Bac. Ι. ii. 29: demand,
Poen. V. ii. 124. ’
