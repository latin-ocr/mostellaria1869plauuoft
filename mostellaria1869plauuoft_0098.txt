lxii PROLEGOMENA.

Priscian (p. 1326) takes a totally different view of these verses;
“ Terentius trochaico mixto vel confuso cum iambico utitur in
sermone personarum, quibus maxime imperitior hic convenit, quern
puto ut imitetur hanc confusionem rhythmorum facere. Sunt autem
trimetri ac plus minusque, et habent penultimam versus syllabam in
quibusdam longam, et in quibusdam breve, ut in Andria.’' He then
quotes the first four lines quoted above, and then goes on, “Haec

sequitur dimeter catalecticus finiendi sermonis causa, quem ad Ar-
chillida habuit ;

Date, mox ego huc revertor.

Similiter Plautus in Truculento eodem metro usus est in sermone
ancillae Astaphii ;

Ad fhres auscultate, atque asservale aedes,

Ne quis adventor gravior abeat atque adveniat,
Neu quis manus attulerit steriles intro ad nos,
Gravz'das sores exportet, novi ego hominum mores.''

The lines to which he refers in Plautus (Truc. Ι. ii. seqq.) are called
by &Veise Saturnian J

We rnay now proceed to discuss in detail all the Bacchiae Verses
in the Mostellaria. The peculiarities which these exhibit in their
structure will, when explained, be sufficient to enable the intel-
ligent student to examine for himself those which appear in other
plays.

A number of Bacchiacs occur in Act. I. ii. 1 seqq, and these we
shall give according to the arrangement of Hermann, noting the
changes which he has introduced into the text, which are neither
numerous nor important. It is to be understood that the whole of
these lines are Tetrameters Acatalectic, except such as are specially
noted as belonging to a different species—

τ’. 1. Molossus in 2nd place.

v. 2. Molossus in 1st and 3rd. Inslt'luz', the reading of the
MSS„ was changed by Reizius into z’nstz'lz'vz', a form analogous to
posz'vz', from pono.

v. 3. Pure.

v. 4. Pure, but the MSS. have eam rem volutavi, which scans
equally well if we pronounce diu as a monosyllable, and make a
Molossus in the 4th place ε1 hence any change seems quite un-
necessary.

v. 5. A Trimeter Acat. with Ionic a minore in 1st‚ followed by
two Molossi.
