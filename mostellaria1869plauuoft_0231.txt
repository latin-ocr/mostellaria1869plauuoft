ACTVS III. SCENA ΙΙ. 53

Qom me laudas. TR. Decet certe. SI. Hercle> ÷÷te
habeo hau
Bonum teneo servom.

ΤΗ. Heia, mastigia, ad me redi! TR. Iam istic ero.

SI. Qid nunc? quam mox? TR. Qd est? SJ. Qod
solet fieri.
TR. Dic [igitur‚ quod solet fieri]‚ quid id est? 35
[SI. Qid facitis vos? Sed ut verum, Tranio]‚ loquar,
Sic decet, [ut homines sunt]³ ita morem geras,
Vita quam sit brevis, simul cogita . . . Qid?
TR. Ehem, vix tandem percepi, super his rebus nostris
te loqui.
SI. Musice hercle agitis aetatem ita, ut vos decet: 40

31, 32. XVe have printed these two lines in the corrupt and mutilated
form in which they appear in BCD. In B there are several corrections
by a late hand. In V. 31 C has mel audis for me laudus, and D has dicet
for decet, while the words Haubonumteneoservom are said to be legible in A.
Camer. thus remodels the lines—

Qom me laudas. Tr. Decet certe. Si. Certe hercle; at ego te
Haud bonurn teneo servom. Tr. Qid ita vero, Simo

It is unnecessary to enumerate the conjectures of other scholam, all being
alike mere flights of imagination.

33. This line appears in a corrupt form in the MSS. A is said to have
HEIAMAST1G1AADMEREDICUMERo, the three letters below which we have

placed dots being very doubtful. B has Eia mastigia ad me redieram
istic ero C has Etiam astigia admere die amisticero. D has Eia mastigia
ad me redie. am inicere, with a space. Combining these we form the
Vulg. which is given in the text, and probably approximates to the true
reading. It has been adopted by RW, who, however, have isti instead
of istic. In the Vulg. the line is placed at v. 71 of the preceding scene.
R places it at v. 52 of this scene.

34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Here again the MSS. are sadly mutilated.
The words which appear in the text within brackets are the conjectures
by which Camer. endeavoured to fill up the blanks. ln ν. 34 A is said to
exhibit QVODSOLETFIERIHIQ and another line appears which has been
thus decyphered—

INTUSQUIDIDESTSCISTIBIQUOD . . . . SOLETFIERI.

BCDF agree, except that in v. 35 Dic is found in Bb only. B has Lic.
CDF have Hic, and in v. 38 CD have brevi, and CDF simul, while simul is
added as a correction in B. Camer. Vulg. W. print v. 40 as two lines—

Tr. Qid? ehem uix tandem
Percepi super his rebus nostris te loqui.

The last line is quoted by Festus (p. 305, ed. Miill.)‚ where wc read
percipio and loqui te, omitting his.
