METRE AND PROSODY. lxi

There is a system of Tetrameters Acat. and Tetrameters Cat. in

Men. V. vi. 1—
Spectamen bono servo id est, qui rem herilem
Procurat, videt, collocat, cogitat,
Vt apsente hero suo* rem heri dilzgrenter
T utetur, quam si ipse assit, aut rectius:
Tergum, quam gulam, crura, quam ventrem, oportet
Potiora esse‚† quoi cor modeste situm est.
Recordetur id, qui nihili sunt‚‡ quid illis
Preti detur ab suis lteris, improbis
Ignavis viris, verbera et compedes.
Molae [magna] lassitudo, fames, frigus durum.

It will be observed that in these Catalectic lines the third and
fourth feet are uniforrnly Bacehii.

The following are regarded by Hermann as Bacchiae Dimeters
Catalectic‚ while by Weise they are scanned as Dochmiacs: Pers.

V. ii. 28—
Perge ut coeperas

Hoc leno tibi

* * *

Delude ut lubet

Herus dum hinc abest
21< ss *

Videsne ut tuis
Dictis pareo.
Bentley detected‚ or believed that he had detected, a few Bacchiacs
in the Andria, ΙΙΙ. ii. 1—
Adhuc, Archylis, quae adsolent quaeque oportet
Szgna esse ad salutem, omnia huic esse video,
Nunc primum fac istaec lavet: post deinde
Quod iussi ei dari bibere, et quantum inperavi
Date, mox ego huc revertor.§

The first line presents no difficulty3 in the second we must scan
eslse video Ι as a Bacchius; in the third, deinde must be a trisyllable ;
in the fourth we have the second Paeon in the 2nd placen But

* Suo, a monosyllable.

† lonic a minore in first place, unless we pronounce potyora.

ἶ Ionic a minore in third place, unless we read niti.

§ If the lines are really Bacchiacs, it is the only example of this class
of verses to be found in Terence.

Η Bentley seems to have supposed that any one of the Paeons was
admissible in the 2nd‚ 3rd, and 4th places, v.l.s.c.
