MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. ix

Some plays, amongst which is the Mostellaria, have been very
carefully corrected, and by different hands, in others the corrections
are few and insignificant, in others wanting altogether.

Such then being the state of the MS. as a whole, it will be evidently
necessary to describe the portion of the MS. which applies to each
play separately, as the remarks which apply to one portion will
obviously not necessarily hold good of another.

The Asostellaria is written upon twelve sheets, of which ten are
complete, eight lines at the beginning of the first being occupied with
the conclusion of the Bacchides, and twenty-five at the close of the
twelfth being devoted to the commencement of the stleneclzmus. Each
complete page contains, as a rule, fifty-two lines, but two or three
have only fifty-one, one or two fifty-three. We have first of all the
tine, meri) PLAUTI MUSTELLARIA, in red capitals; then we
have the acrostic argument in eleven lines, which reads Mostellarm,

and then without a break
GRUMIO—TRANIO. SERVI II in red-ink capitals.

At the top of each left-hand page we have Plauti, at the top of
each right-hand page Allustellarz'ffi each in a large cursive hand. At

the conclusion,
PLAUTI MUSTELLARIA EXPLICIT

INCIPIT MENECHMUS . ARGUMEN MENECHMI

all in red capitals.

The play seems to be written from beginning to end in the same
hand, though it is impossible to assert this posidvely, as in several
places the size of the hand is suddenly enlarged (e. g. 1. ii. 22-29‚
ΙΙΙ. ii. 69-73)‚ the original size being resumed after a few lines,
while the last leaf, especially where it joins the Menechmus, is written
in ink of a darker shade‚ and very probably by a different hand, from
the rest. The changes in the size of hand may possibly have arisen
from blanks having been lest when the MS. was first transcribed,
which were subsequently filled up from other sources.

C orreclz'ons.

These are by many different hands.

1. Corrections evidently made by the first hand on casual slips‚
the colour of the ink being the same as that of the original writing.

2. Corrections made over an erasure, where the colour of the ink
having been changed by the roughened surface, it is extremely

-difficult to determine whether they procccded from the first or from
