NOTES. Ι. i. 9—15. 97

—· hoccine] So haeccine, acc. pl. neut. v. 24; hoccine, acc. sing. neut.
v. 263 hoccine moda, v. 2 5.

12. frutex] i. e. ‘you dunderhead.’ Frutex properly signifies ‘a
shrub’ or ‘ dwarf tree,’ also ‘the stalk of a plant.' There is a line in
Terence, Heaut. V. i. 4, which may serve as a commentary, In mc
quidvis harum rerum convenit Quae sunl dicta in stultum, caudex, sufes,
asinus, plumbeus, and we ourselves talk of a fellow as being ‘ a poor
stick’ or ‘a perfect stick.’* R. has adopted the conjecture of Guyetus
and has introduced rupex into his text, a word quoted by Festus
(s. v. squarrosos, p. 329, ed. Mfill.) from Lucilius, and which, as we
gather from Aul. Gell. (xiii. 9) and Tertullian (De Pall. 4, with note
of Salmasius, Apol. 21, De Anima, 6), signifies ‘an ignorant boor.’
Since all the best MSS. agree in frutex, no change is necessary.

14. deliciae popli] This in the English edition of Forcellini is
rendered, ‘the sport and diversion of the people,' but it means
rather ‘the darling of the people‚’ i. e. ‘of society.' This is the
sense of deliciae in Catull. ΙΙ. 1, Passer deliciae meae puellae,· and so
in Plautus, Poen. I. ii. 152, we find it in a string of endearing
appellations, Illea voluptas! meae deliciae ,Ι mea ἰ’ίία ,Ι mea amoenilas !
M eus ocellus ,Ι mcum labellum! mea salus J meum suavium flleum mel!
meum cor! mea coloslra .Ι meus molliculus caseus ,Ι and so in Pseud.
I. ii. 47, quibus deliciae eslz's ‚· v. 90, Phoenicium . . deliciae summatum
virum ,· Pers. ΙΙ. ii. 22, Paegnium, deliciae pueri, salve (‘ you darling,
darling boy') ; and Stich. V. v. 1, Morem vobis geram, meae deliciae!
and we have several examples in Cicero. We shall have occasion to
say more about this word in the note on IV. iii. 9 in this play. In
Asin. V. ii. 35, Subrzpiam in deliciis pallam quam habel, i. e. ‘ which
she loves so much.’

15. Rus mihi tu obiectas] i. e. ‘do you cast the country in my
teeth ?’ The Scotch phrase, ‘to cast up a thing to any one,’ i. e. ‘to
reproach any one with a thing,' is still more close. Below, in
ΙΙΙ. ii, 121, Ah! cave lu illi obiectes nunc in aegritudine Te has emisse,
‘do not taunt him' (remind him). The phrase is varied in Truc.
II. ii. 25, Rus tu mihi opprobras? ul nacla cs hominem quem pudeal
probri. With regard to the contemptuous use of rus we may corn-
pare Truc. ΙΙ. ii. 14, Rus merum lzoc quidem est, ‘this is rustic
coarseness in perfection,’ ‘this is a pure specimen of a coarse country
clown.'

* Lapis is used in the same sense, Merc. III iv. 46, egomet credidi
Homini docto rem mandare, is lapidi mando maxumo.
