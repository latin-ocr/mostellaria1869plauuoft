METRE AND PROSODY. ciii

Quem infestum ac odiosum „Thi &Te memorabat mala,

where sibi is elided altogether.
Inest is a monosyllable in Mil. III. i. 38 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Inest in hoc amussz'tata sua sibi ingenua indoles,

where there is no doubt as to the reading. So is est, Trin. III. ii.
71 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Is est honos homine· pudico meminisse qfficium suum,

 

where however we might get rid of the difficulty by a simple trans-
position, Is lzonos esl‚· II. iii. 73 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

 

Is est immunis quoi nz'lzz'l est qui munus fungatur suum.

This line occurs in a long unbroken system of Troch. Tetrameters‚
and so there can be little doubt as to the measure. Observe however
that the line might be scanned as an Iamb. Tetr. Acat., and the same
remark applies to the preceding line.

 

Adest (according to the other view, datast) is quoted from Trin.
Prol. 3,

 

Adest, en, illae sunt aedes. I intro nunc 'iani

So Hermann ; but as the MSS„ including A, have hem for en, the
example is not satisfactory. Bac. IV. ix. 63 (Iamb. Tetr. Acat.),

 

Nunc superum limen scinditur l nunc adest exilium Ilio.

Weise quotes Truc. V. 28 and Cas. II. iii. 30 as instances of ἇαῖε,
but neither example is satisfactory.

Quid est must be pronounced as a monosyllable in Rud. IV. iv. 16
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Quid est de qua re litigatis nunc inter vos Β T Eloquar.
In Most. I. i. 66 (Senan),
Quid est? quid lu me nunc opluere, ficrcffer?

 

if we pronounced opluffre, then quidest must be a monosyllable; but

if we take the form optuit-e, quid est will form an Iambus. Cist. V. 1
(Troch. Tetr. Cat.),

Quid Ιιῖἷ negoti esl ffod omnes homines fabulantur per viam :³

 

 

Quid is absorbed in Most. IV. iii. 20 (iv. 20), where the Iamb. Trim.
begins with—

 

Quid a T ranione servo?

so Trin. II. ii. 36 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.),
sziffxprobras κ) bene quod seczsli,· tibi secisli non milii.
