might blab, when from home‚’ where foras might be substituted for
foris, and effutire foras would signify ‘ blab out the secret.' Foris, in
the sense of from without, does not appear in the earliest Latin writers,
but is so used by Lucretius V. 544 and by Cicero.

2. exhibes argutias] i. e. ‘playing off your quips on me.' Comp.
Bac. I. ii. 19, Etiam me advorsus exordire argutias? The root arg
seems to have eonveyed the idea of brilliant light, and hence the
words into which it enters denote something slzim'ng, or white, or
piercing. Passing from the Greek ἀργός, ἀργεννός, ἀργύριον, we have in
Latin argentum, ‘the brilliant white metal ;' argilla, ‘ white clay ς’ and
the verb arguo, which properly signifies to ‘ pierce’ or ‘ penetrate‚' and
when applied to the mind, ‘prove’ or ‘ convince? Hence argutus, in
reference to sounds, signifies strictly ‘ sharp‚’ ‘ shrill ;' in reference to
the mind of man, ‘acute,’ ‘penetrating3’ and argutiae are ‘subtleties,’ and
in a bad sense ‘ sophisms,’ ‘verbal tricks.' According, then, as we
select the literal or the figurative meaning, argutus lzomo may signify
either a shrewd, sharp fellow (as opposed to ‘a flat')‚ or simply
one who is ‘ a noisy chatterer.' In Truc. ΙΙ. vi. 12, arguti are clever
talkers, Strenui nimio plus prosunt populo quam arguti et cati. Facile
sibi facunditatem virtus argutam invenit, Sine virtute argutum cirem
mihilzabeam pro praefica* In Trin. Ι. ii. 163, which will be quoted in
the note on ν. 14, argutus is applied to ‘garrulous gossipers.' For
argutus see also Merc. III. iv. 44, Pseud. II. iv. 56 ; argute,
Trin. IV. ii. 132; argutarz'e’r, ‘to quibble,’ Amph. 1. i. 193. In
Amph. III. ii. 2, argutam is the participle, and means ‘charged,'
‘ accused.’

3. herilis pernicies] ‘thou that art thy master’s bane.' There is
for the most part little difficulty in determining the force of the epithet
herilis in Plautus. Thus no doubt can exist with regard to herilis
filius, filia, amica, concubina, res, patria ,· herile imperium, negotium.†
Herilis metus (Amph. V. i. 17) signifies ‘the alarm which I felt for
the safety of my mistress ;' custos herilis (As. III. iii. 65), ‘thou that
art the guardian of thy master.' In Poen. I. ii. 73, Nam pro herili et
nostro quaestu satis bene ornatae sumus signifies‚ ‘in so far as regards
our master’s profit and our own ;’ but the most difficult combination is

tando means ‘ with piercing eries!
