11.—D VM

Dum is strictly an adverb of time, and may be regarded as in all
cases equivalent to one of two English words.

I. ‘Now‚’ ‘ at this present time.'

ΙΙ. ‘While‚' applied generally to time, with its compounds ‘ whilst,'
‘until‚’ ‘ till’ (while-es, unto-while, to-while Ρ).

Ι. Dum signifying ‘now :’ Trin. V. ii. 1, chque fuit, neque erit,

believe that there is at this present time on earth‚' where, however, it
must be remarked that in terra dum is an emendation of Camerarius,

In the following examples we have eliam dum in negative propo-
sitions‚ ‘not even n0w‚' ‘ not even yet‚' ‘not even now at this present
time ε’ Truc. ΙΙ. ii. 66, T rt'slis exit: haud convenit etiam hic dum
Phronesium, ‘not even now has he had an interview with Phro-
nesium ;' Pseud. IV. ii. 2, m'lzz'l ellam dum harpagavil praeter cuathum
