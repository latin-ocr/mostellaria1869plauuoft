These words convey the idea os ‘excess.' But it must be borne
in mind that excess may be of two kinds. The word may denote
that the object spoken os transcends the limits of what is right,
proper, or convenient, in which case censure is conveyed, or it may
denote that the object spoken of transcends the limits by which such
an object is usually bounded, and in this case censure or praise, or
neither, may be conveyed, according to circumstances. The former
meaning is usually expressed in English by the word ‘ too,' the latter
by ‘excessively‚' ‘most,’ ‘very‚’ and is equivalent to a superlative.
Thus when we say that a person or thing is loo long, or too short,
too rich, or loo poor, we wish to indicate that the proper limit‚ in
each case, has been passed; but when we say that a person or thing
is excessiz'ely long, or excessively short, excesszbcly rich, or excessiveht
paor, we do not necessarily imply anything except that the usual or
ordinary limit has been passed. In Latin, ll't'mz's, Mnu‘us, are used
in both senses, and we must, in each case, be guided by the con-
text in determining which os the two is applicable. The same takes
place in our own language with ‘too,’ but to a very small extent, in
such colloquial phrases as that is loo good, too dclighlficl, loo charmt'ng,
too ridiculous, too absurd. The following examples will illustrate
what we have said.

1. le‘mis. In such passages as the following, m'mz‘s must signify

On the other hand it has the force os ἄγαν, valde, ‘excessively‚’ in

capul, i. e. ‘very much should 1 like to have a stone‚' &c.; so nimis
