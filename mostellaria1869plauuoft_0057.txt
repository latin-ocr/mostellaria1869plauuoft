ORTHOGRAPHY. xxvii

In point of fact, as far as we can learn from inscriptions, there
was no method in general use, in the earliest period of Roman
literature, by which the vowels ᾶ, ἒ, ὃ, when pronounced long, were
distinguished in orthography from the same vowels when pronounced
short. We have seen that there is no trace of anything of the kind
in the very oldest inscriptions, and although we find occasionally in
some inscriptions engraved before the downfall of the Republic
such forms as FAATO, MAANIVM‚ NAATAM, PAASTORES,
SEEDES, REE‚ and the proper names, MAARCVS, MAAR-
CIVS, STAATIVS, VAARVS, VAARIVS, FEELIX, and a
few others, which are collected in the Index to Mommsen, these
are for the most part solitary examples scattered over a wide
area.

With regard to those words which in later times were written
with long u, we find the long vowel represented sometimes by the
diphthong 01', as in OINO, PLOIRVME [2]‚ COMOINEM,
OINVORSEI [10], MOINICIPIVM quater, OINA [14]‚ ΟΙΤΙ-
LE [15]‚ less frequently by oe, as POENICIO, OETVNTVR
[14]‚ but often by ou, as ABDOVCIT, LOVCANAM [1], IN-
DOVCERE, INDOVCIMVS, INDOVCEBAMVS [15]‚ IOVBEA-
TIS [10], IOVSERVNT [13], IOVSERIT [12]‚ IOVSISET [10],
IOVS [12‚ 14, 18], IOVDEX [11, 12], IOVDICO [11, 12, 14],
ADIOVDICARI [14]‚ IOVDICIVM [11, 12], IOVDICATIO
[12]‚ IOVRO [11, 12], CONIOVRASE, NOVNDINVM‚ PLOVS
[10].

On the other hand, we have VIRTVTEI [1], VIRTVTES,
VIRTVTEI [5].

The uncertainty that prevailed in the early part of the seventh
century with regard to such words* is well illustrated by the Tables
of the Lex Servilia, in which we find IOVS, IOVDEX, IOVDICES,
IOVDICIVM, IOVDICIO, IOVDICATO, IOVDICET, IOVDI-
CA(TA), IOVDICANDAM, intermingled sreely with IVDEX,
IVDICEI, IVDICEM, IVDICES, IVDICVM, IVDICIBVS¹

* Great uncertainty prevails also in the inscriptions anterior to the
death of Caesar, with regard to the orthography of the perfect tense of
the verb CVRO. Not only do we find CVRAVERVNT, CVRAVERE,
but more frequently COIRAVIT, COIRAVERVNT, COIRARVNT,
COIRAVERE or COERAVIT, COERARVNT, COERAVERINT,
COERAVERE; in one instance, CORAVERONT (n. 63); and in one,
QRAVERVNT (n. 1428). In fact, in inscriptions commemorating the
erection of some monument, the expression FACIVNDVM COIRAVIT
(AVgElIRhVN'IJ) or COERAVIT (AVERVNT) seem to have been the
esta is ed orms.
