⁴NOTES. 111. i. μ. 153

passages: Cure.¹ V. ii. 15, Quod argentum, quas lu mihi lrz'cas narras?
Pers. V. ii. 17, Quid als, crux, stz'nculorum tritor ,Ρ quomodo me hodie
vorsavz'slz'! Vt me z'n lrz'cas coniecisti! In Rud. V. ii. 36, T rz'cas ! means
‘pshaw,’ ‘nonsense,' ‘mere trash3’ Pers. IV. iii. 61, nilu'l mihi opus
est Lz'lz'bus neque trz‘czs, i. e. ‘quibblesl Cicero uses the word in
the sense of ‘ embarrassments,’ ‘hindrances :’ domesticas fricas, ad Att.
X. 8, sub. fin. See also Caelius in ad. Fam. VIII. 5. The original
and proper meaning of tricae seems to have been ‘threads,' and from
the passage quoted above from Pers. V. ii. 17 compared with IV. i. 9,
it is clear that it denoted ‘a noose' or ‘snare ;’ hence the transition
is easy to ‘a trick’ or ‘deception,’ and hence, as in Pers. IV. iii. 61,
-it means ‘paltry legal trieks⁷ or ‘quibbles,' and hence in Rud. V.
ii. 36 the exclamation lrz'cas! is one of contempt,—-‘ what you offer
is a paltry subterfuge ;’ and it may be observed that the expression
of contempt used by Gripus in the next clause is lramas putridas.
Lexicographers have sought a different origin and explanation of the
word, refern'ng to Pliny H. N. III. ii.§ 16, where he is discussing
the geography of Apulia. He mentions Arpc¹ as having been founded
by Diomedes and named Argos Hippium‚ which was subsequently
corrupted into Argyrippa, and then goes on, Diomedes z'bz' delevit gentes
Monadorum Dardorumque el urbes duas quae in proverbi ludicrum
vertere, Apz'nam el Tricam. The proverb itself is to be found in
Martial XIV. i. 7, who, when about to write a series of distiches
descriptive of the small gifts interchanged by all classes at the
Saturnalia, says, Sunt apinae lrz'caeque el si quid villus istis, ‘they are,
I admit, trash and trumpery;' and again, Ι. cxiv. 2, Quaecumque lusi
iuvenis et puer quondam Apinasque nostras, quas nec ipse z'am novi, &C.
Now although the Romans may have been unable to explain the
origin of the proverbial expression Apz'nae Triviaeque, and although
we may find it difficult to give any account of Apz'nae, no sober-
minded philologist will be willing to accept and rest satisfied with
the story of Pliny about the two towns destroyed by Diomedes.
Non. Marcellus p. 8, seems to consider that tricae is the same
word as the Greek τρίχες, “ T ricae sunt impedimenta et implicationes
dictae quasi tericae quod pullos gallinaceos involvant et impediant
capilli pedibus implicati.'’ T rico-onis in the sense of ‘a shuffling knave'
or ‘cheat’ is quoted twice by Nonius (s. v. T meones, p. 22) from Lu-
cilius, Lucz'u' Cotta senex, Crassi paler huz'u' Panaeti ,Magnus lricofuz'l
nummarz'u' solvere nulli, Lentus,· and again (s. v. T ricae, p. 338), Nec
mz'lu' amatore hoc opu' nec lrz'cone vadala .· and the word reappears

again in the Augustan Historians (Capitolin. Ver. 4.) in the sense
