eius caput Iovi sacrum esset: familia ad aedem Cereris, Liberi, Liber-
aeque, venum iret, on which Livy remarks, Hac lege iuris interpretes
negant quemquam sacrosanctum esse, sed eum qui eorum cuiquam nocuerit
sacrum sanciri. See also Law of XII. Tables quoted by Serv. ad
Virg. AEn. VI. 609, and Hor. S. II. iii. 181, is intestabilis et sacer esto.
The theory seems to have been that any man who was solemnly made
over and devoted to a God was thereby placed beyond the pale of
human sympathy and protection. It is commonly asserted that an
individual under these circumstances was sacer dis inseris, but in both
quotations given above where a God is named it is Iupiter. See
Macrob. S. III. 7. Sacer in the general sense of ‘ worthless‚’ ‘good-
for-nothing‚' ‘vile‚' was originally, as might be expected, applied to
persons only, and this is the case uniformly in Plautus and the earliest
writers (Bac. IV. vi. 14, Poen. Prol. 90, Rud. I. ii. 69), but Catullus
applies the epithet to a book, XIV. 1 2, Di magni, horribilem et sacrum
libellum, and to a rank smell, LXXI. 1, Si quoi, Virro, bono sacer
alarum obstitit hircus, while the auri sacra fames of virgil (AEn. III.
57) has passed into a proverb. With regard to the use of unus in
the line before us we have an exact parallel in Truc. II. i. 39, Sed est
huic unus servos violenttssumus.

45. is vel Herculi conterere quaestum possiet] The wealth of
Hercules was proverbial among the Romans. 1. He was regarded
as the guardian of hidden treasures‚ and those who discovered
such hoards were wont to ascribe their good fortune to the favour
of the God; thus Hor. S. ΙΙ. νί. 10, 0 si urnam argenti fors quae
mihi monstret, ut illi Thesauro invento qui mercenarius agrum Illum
ipsum mercatus aravit, dives amico Hercule,· and Pers. S. II. 10, 0
si Sub rastro crepet argenti mihi seria, dextro Hercule. Indeed it
would appear that, according to popular belief, Hercules was looked
upon in the same light as those spirits who in Eastern and Northern
mythology are supposed to dwell beneath the earth, brooding over
and watching hidden gold ; thus Acron explains the allusion in
Horace, Ideo quia thesauris praeest, et sunt qui eundem Incubonem esse
velint, to which we may add the following curious notice in the tract
known to writers on Roman topography as Curiosum Vrbis Romae*
Among the remarkable objects in the Regio XIV, the Transtiberina,

* The title at full length as it appears in the Vatican MS. is—Incipit
Curiosum urhis Romae Regionum XIIII cum Brebiariis suis. It will be found
in Muratori‚ Thes. Inscrip. T. 1V., and is given at the end of the first
volume of Becker’s Handbuch der R'omischen Altherthiimer. See also
Bunsen, Beschreibung der S. R. Tom. 1. p. 175. It probably belongs to
the early part of the fourth century.
