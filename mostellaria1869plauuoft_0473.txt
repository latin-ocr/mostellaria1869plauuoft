EXCVRSVS XVIL—-TERMS OF ABUSE, ‹ft-c. 285

Am. Ecastor quin subrepturum pallam promisit tibi: but it will be
seen, on referring to the passage, that the last line might proceed
quite as naturally from Philenium as from Argyrippus.

A third example is given from Cas. V. iv. 13, where the words
Times ecastor are assigned to Olympio; but it is not worth while
to discuss this, for the whole of the concluding portion of the play
is so mutilated that no reliance can be placed on the text, and a large
blank commences in this very line.

Again, in order to prove that women sometimes swear by Her-
cules, we are referred to Merc. IV. iii. 22, where the words Cupio
hercle scire are given to Dorippa; and to Truc. V. 29, where Phro-
nesium is made to exclaim, Hercle vero serio.

In the former passage, Ritschl, following Bothe, slightly alters the
arrangement of the lines, and attaches Cupio hercle scz‘re to the
previous speech of Lysimachus3 Quid autem urbani deliquerunt fl dic
mihi, Cupio hercle scire. D. Sic tu me temptas sciens .· which, upon
studying the passage, will be found to be a much better arrangement.

In the latter there is no reason to prevent us from considering
that the words in question are an indignant exclamation proceeding
from Stratophanes, and nothing can be more probable, α priori, than
that some confusion should arise in the distribution of the dialogue
from the circumstance that the first four letters in the names Strabax
and Stratophanes are identical.

It is very possible that some other apparent exceptions may be
found, but we have little doubt that they may be disposed of as
easily as the foregoing.
