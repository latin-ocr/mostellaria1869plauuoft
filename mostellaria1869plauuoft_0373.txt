EXCVRSVS 111.—ETJAM. 189

ridicule, and thus the idea of addition is connected with ‘even now,’ as
it is with ‘still' and ‘yet,’ in such phrases as ‘give me still (or yet)
another volume,' that is, a volume ‘in addition to’ those previously
given. All these words may denote the repetition of an action, and
hence eliam alque eliam means ‘again and again.'

4. But the expression ‘is the man even now awake?' may imply
‘is the man, having been for some time asleep, yet awake?’ and
hence ‘even now' may indicate that things having continued in one
particular state for some time, this state has been or is likely to be
‘interrupted Questions such as the above are frequently put with
some degree of surprise or impatience, and this is often rendered
emphatic in English by the introduction of a negative. Thus, ‘is the
man not even now awake ?' ‘is the man not going even now to hold
his tongue ?' and hence ‘even now’ is often equivalent to ‘at last!

We may proceed to give examples of eliam under each of the
above heads.

1. ‘Even now‚' ‘at this present time,’ &c.; Amph. Ι. i. 47, Sed quo
modo el verbis quibus me decelsabulare'er, Prius zpse mecum eliam i'olo lzz'c
meditari, i. e. ‘ even now, at this present time ;' Aul. IV. iv. 6, Verbera-
bz'le'ssume, etiam rogz'las? non sur, sed lrzsur, ‘do you even now heap
questions on me when I have detected you in the very act of trying
to rob me?’ Most. III. i. 19, Elium salelur de hospite? ‘does he even
now (after being accused by you) confess about his guest ?’ Pers. IV.
iii. 72, Ellam lu illam (hermas.) D. Videam modo fllercc'momum, ‘are
you going to buy her even now—on the spot?’ In both of the last
quoted examples we should in English have inserted a negative:
‘does he not even now confess?’ and ‘ar’nt you going to buy her
On the spot?' V. ii. 66, D. stlalum vobis dabo. T. At tihi nos dedi-⁴
mus dabimusque eliam. D. Hez'nales pervellit! It is evident from the
exclamation of Dordalus that the threat of Toxilus was instantly exe-
cuted. 1 would therefore translate, ‘we have brought missortune upon
you, and we will do the same even now’ or ‘directly,' rather than
render eliam by ‘ again' or ‘in addition.' Cas. ΙΙ. viii. 86, Stalino says
to Olympio, ‘be off with you (abi), 1 do not wish money to be spared,
purchase liberally,' and then adds, with reference to abi, lVam mihi
vicino hoc eliam convento est opus, ‘ for I must have a meeting with this
neighbour of mine even now (directly).' Pseud. Ι. v. 153, Pseudolus,
addressing his audience, says, ‘I dare say you suppose that Ι have
promised to perform all these achievements merely to keep you
amused, and that Ι have not really any intention of carrying them
out‚’ AVon demutabo .· alque etiam [quod] certum sciam, Quo sim facturus
