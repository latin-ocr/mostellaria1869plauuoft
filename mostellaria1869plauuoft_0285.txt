NOTES. l. i. 57. 105

may be written as two distinct words, compendi sace, for the component
parts are frequently separated. The phrase facere aliquid compendi
properly signifies, 1. ‘to save ς’ 2. ‘to abridge;' and hence ‘to cut
short.’ Thus, Bac. II. ii. 6, Compendi mulla verba iam faciam libi,
i. e. ‘I shall make a long story short for you‚' *Ι shall save you
the trouble of making a long speech.' So Pseud. IV. vii. 42, Quis-
quis es, adulescens, operam fac compendi quaerere, ‘save yourself the
trouble.’ Again, Truc. II. iv. 26, Si quid tibi Compendi facere possim,
factum edepol velim, i. e. ‘if Ι can make any saving for you;’ and
Pers. IV. iii. 2, lVam ego hodie compendi feci binos panes indies, i. e. ‘ I
have made a saving of two loaves per day.’ The passive offacio is
also used, As. II. ii. 41, Verbivelitationem fieri compendi volo, i. e. ‘I wish
this skirmishing of words to be cut short.y Sometimes compendium
is put in the accusative, followed by a genitive or dative, Rud. Ι.
ii. 90, Si ad saxum quo capessit,* ea deorsum cadit Errationt's jecerit
compendium, i. e. ‘ she will have brought her wanderings to an
abrupt termination‚' ‘save herself from all further wandering.' In
Stich. I. iii. 39, Haec verba subigunt me mores ul barbaros Discum,
alque ut faciam praeconis compendium, Itaque auctionem praedicem,
ipse ut venditent, the reading, as sar as the last word is con-
cerned, is very doubtful. The Palatine MSS. are corrupt, but the
Palimpsest has preserved the true reading, and the meaning is
tolerably clear. The parasite says that he is about to have a sale
of his property by auction after the Roman fashion, and that he
will save llze expense of an auctioneer by acting in that capacity
himself. So facere compendium pullandi, ‘to cease from‚' Pseud. II.
ii. 11. Again, in Capt. V. ii. 12, with the dative, Sales facundus es,
sed iam fieri dictes compendium volo. A verb different from facere is
occasionally employed, Mil. III. i. 186, Quam poles tam verba corffer
maxume ad compendium. And we have ponere ad compendium in Cas.
ΙΙΙ. i. 3, 5, where ponito ad compendium means ‘cut short by leaving
that out.’ See the passage. Finally‚ since, according to the proverb,
what is saved is gained, we find facere compendium signify ‘to make
an acquisition 3' Bac. Ι. ii. 51, Compendium, edepol, haud aelati optabile,
Fecisti, cum islanc nactus es impudentiam; where it must be regarded
as opposed to dispendium. And indeed this seems to lead to the
true meaning of the phrase, which seems to be, ‘to make a saving of,’
and hence, to ‘ spare‚’ ‘cut short‚’ compendium signifying a saving or
contraction of expenditure, just as dispendium signifies a lavish outlay.
