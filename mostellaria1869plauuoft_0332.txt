shouldn’t wonder if that fellow were either a robber or a cut-purse.'
In Trin. II. iv. 94, after Philto had been moralising upon the lot of
man, and declaring that rich and poor after they had passed into the
nether world were upon a complete equality as far as wealth was con-
cerned, Stasimus, according to the Vulgate text, is made to say, M'rum
nitu illuc tecum dz'vz'tt'asfiras, which cannot be explained according to
the view we have given of mirum πί. But the Milan Palimpsest gives
here ANMlRUMQmN'rU, and the Pan. MSS. (BCD) An mirum im'to or an
mirum ini tu, while mirum ni is found only in the interpolated MSS.
and Ed. Prin. Hence there can be little doubt that R has restored
the true reading, Mirum quin tu illo tecum divitias feras, i. e. ‘it is very
likely, isn’t it, that you could carry your riches to the other world‚'—
a contemptuous sneer, which is quite appropriate and in character.
70. Desodt't insepultum clam] Clam and Palam are employed as
adverbs in the sense of ‘seeretly’ and ‘openly,' and are often directly
opposed to each other; thus Merc. V. iv. 63, Si quis prohibuerit plus
perdet clam, quam si praehibuerit palam. Clam is sometimes combined
with another adverb, as Poen. III. iii. 49, At enim ln'c clam furtim esse
volt. Clam, moreover, is in very many passages used as a preposition
governing the accusative, or the ablative, or, more rarely, the genitive,
and in this case signifies ‘without the knowledge of' or ‘concealed
from the knowledge of;’ thus Cas. Prol. 51, Pater filiusque clam alter
alterum, ‘the one without the knowledge of the other ;' Most. V. i. 13,
lVam scz’o equidem nullo pacto iam esse posse clam senem, ‘that in no
way can the truth be concealed fr0m3' Merc. 111. ii. 2, with the abla-
tive‚ Empta est amica clam uxore mea et filio ‚· Merc. Prol. 43, with the
genitive, Res exulatum ad illam abibat clam patris. So clam me, Cas.
I. i. 7, Rud. I. ii. 45, Heaut. I. i. 46, 66, Hec. ΙΙ. ii. 10, III. iv. 10,
IV. ii. 13 clam te, Andr. I. v. 52, Eun. IV. vii. 25, Hec. IV. iv. 59,
Phor. V. viii. 15; clam illum, Merc. II. iii. 265 clam uxorem, As. IV. ii.
6, Cas. Prol. 54, II. viii. 15, 32; clam virum, Amph. Prol. 107, Cas.
11. ii. 27. The choice of case seems quite arbitrary, for we have
clam uxorem and clam viro in the same sentence, Merc. IV. vi. 3, 5,
1 1; and no distinction of meaning can be drawn between clam patrem,
Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 8; clam patre, Truc. ΙΙ. i. 375 and clam patris, Merc.
Prol. 43. Palam is not used as a prepositi0n‚ but both clam and
palam, especially the latter, appear as indeclinable adjectives, signi-
fying respectively ‘secret' and ‘evident’ or ‘open ;' thus Adel. I. i.
46, Dum z‘d rescitum z‘rz' credit, tantisper cavet: Si sperat fhre clam,
rursus ad ingenium redit, i. e. ‘if he hopes that what he does will be
secret ;’ and hence facere aliquid palam signifies not ‘to do something
