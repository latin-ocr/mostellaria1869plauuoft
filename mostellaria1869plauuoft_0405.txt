or prohibition are expressed or implied3 thus Most. Ι. iii. 46, Vix
comprimor quin involem illi in oculos stimulatrici, i. e. ‘ Ι can scarcely
restrain myself from' διε. ; and, exactly parallel, Eun. V. ii. 20, Vix
me contineo quin involem z'n Capillum ,· so Epid. ΙΙΙ. iv. 1, Cave praeter-
bz'tas ullas aedes quin roges, Senex ubi habitat Periphanes Platonas,-
and Trin. Ι. ii. 67, Est atque non est mihi in manu, fllegarom'des:
Quin ciebant, non est: merito ut ne dicant, z'd est, i, e. prohibere quin
dicant.

3. Quin, followed by an indicative, is sometimes explanatory or
affirmative3 Epid. ΙΙ. iii. 1, qullum esse opz'nor ego agrum z'n agro
Attico, Aeque feracem quam lzz'c est noster Persphanex Quin ex occulto
atque opsz'gnato armario Deculio argenti tantum quantum mihi lubet,
where quin is introduced to explain the metaphor employed in the
two preceding lines, ‘why, Ι tell you,’ or, ‘for you see ;' Rud. ΙΙΙ. iv. 62,
L. Ignem magnum hic-faciam. D. Quin ut humanum exuras tibi, where
quin is equivalent to vedelz'cet. Daemones pretends to interpret or ex-
plain what Latrax had said, ‘for the purpose, Ι presume, of offering
a sacrifice to the dead in honour of yourself,' i. e. ‘in order to burn
yourself ;’ Cist. Ι. ii. 1, Idem mz'lu· magnae quod parti est z’z'tz'um munerum,
Quae lzunc quaestum facimus .· quae ubi saburratae sumus, Largiloquae
extemplo sumus .· plus loquimur quam sat est. ........
Quin ego nunc, quia sum onusta mea ex sententia, Quz'aque adeo me
complevi flore Liberi, llsagz's libera uti lingua conlubz‘tum est mz'ln'. The
old woman remarks that persons of her class, when well ballasted
with liquor, forthwith become talkative, and talk more than is con-
venient; she then proceeds to disclose a piece of secret history, and
interrupting herself goes on, quin ego, ‘why, for example, I at this
time, having got a heavy cargo of wine on board, to my heart’s
content, feel inclined to use my tongue more freely than is expe-
dient.’ In Cas. ΙΙ. iv. 6 we have quin twice in the same line in
different senses3 C. Quin, si ita arbitrare, emittis me manuz³ S. Quin,
id volo, where the first quin is equivalent to cur non, the second is
explanatory, ‘ why, I tell you, I am willing to do that.'

Quin may frequently be rendered by ‘ why, I tell you,' or ‘ why, to
be sure,’ when the speaker manifests eagerness, impatience, or in-
dignation. Eagerness: Heaut. IV. iv. 15, S. Perz‘z' hercle! Bacchis,
mane, mane : quo mittis istanc.) quaeso, Iube maneat. B. I. S. Quin
est paratum argentum. B. Quin ego maneo, ‘ stop, stop, bid her stop ;'
‘why, Ι tell you, the money is all ready,' where the first quin is spoken
in eager excitement, and the word is repeated in mockery by Bacchis,

‘then, Ι tell you, Ι stop.5 Impatiergce: Men. V. iv. 4; the physician
