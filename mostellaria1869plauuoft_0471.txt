>EXCVRSVS XV11.—TERMS OF ABUSE, dcc. 283

and Cas. II. vi. 37, O. Taceo: Deos quaeso . . . C. Vt quidem tu lzodz'e
canem et furcam seras! O. llIz'lzz‘ ut sortltz'o eveniat. C. Vt quidem,
hercle, pedibus pendeas! Ο. At tte ut oculos emungare ex capite per
nasum tuos! ‘but Ι pray that you may blow your eyes out through
your nose !'

4. Actjuratz'ons. No one can fail to be struck by the multitude
of adjurations with which the dialogue in Plautus and Terence is
interlarded‚ and which are, sor the most part, mere explefives, desti-
tute of any particular emphasis, corresponding to the ‘Gad,’ ‘Bedad,’
‘Faith‚' ‘By Jove‚' and a host of others, with which many of our
dramatists were wont to season the discourse of their characters.

The words of this kind which appear to have been most in favour·
with the Romans were, as might be anticipated, appeals to their
popular denies, the Great Twin Brethren and Hercules, expressed
by Pol, Edepol, Illecastor, Ecastor, Harde, &c.

Pol is manifestly an abbreviation of Pollux, and is used either as
an independent ejaculation or in connection with verbs and such
adverbs as certe, sane, prcffecto. The combination Per pol, sound in
Hec. I. i. 1, Per pol quam paucos mperz'as meretricibus Fideles evenire
amatores, Sura, is so strange that commentators have sought to
explain it by tmesis, conjoining the per with quam.

Edepol has been held to be a contractiori sor per aedem Pollucis,
and hence is sometimes printed aedepol, but it is probably merely
another form of Epa, which is found occasionally in the MSS. of
Plautus. Pol and Edepol in the extant Latin writers are freely used
by men and women alike.

Mecastor, we cannot doubt, stands for me, Castor, iuva, or me
Castor iuvet, ‘ so help me, Castor,' as Mehercules or lllelzercule stand
for me, Hercules, iuva, or me Hercules iuvet, and Alledz‘usfia'z'us for me,
Dius Fidius, iuva, or me Dius Fidius iuvet, ‘so help me, God of
Truth.’

Ecastor, although explained like Edepol to be a contraction sor
per aedem Castoris, seems to be simply the name Castor with the
ejaculatory particle e prefixed, as in Equz'rz'ne (Paul. Diac. p. 81, ed.
Muli), Ez‘uno (Charis. p. 183, ed. Puts.)‚ and Epol, noticed above.

Hercule or Hercle* are the forms in which the invocation os this
deity generally appears in Plautus and Terence3 Mehercle‚ although
not without example, is rare—Eun. Ι. i. 22, III. i. 26. The following
passage from Aulus Gellius, XI. 6, is curious: “ In veteribus scriptis

'‘'ff Cic. Orat. XLVII. ξ 157, “Et pomeridianas quadrigas quam postmeri-
dianas libentius dixerim, ct mehercule quarn mchermksff’
