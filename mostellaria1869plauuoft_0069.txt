It is natural to conclude that the sostening of prepositions in
composition by assimilation should have become more and more
general as the cultivation of the language advanced, but it is a
decided mistake to suppose that the practice was altogether unknown
in early times. The statement of Pierius, in his note on the line
(Virg. Aen. IV. 175), lllobz‘lz'lale vzgret viresque adquirit eundo, “Antiqua
pene omnia exemplaria integras servant praepositiones in compo-
sitis, ut adquirit: et ita scribi solitum usque ad Aurelii Antonini Pii
tempora, publica declarant monumenta,'’ can be at once disproved
by many of the “ publica monumenta ’' to which he appeals. Setting
aside the change of ab, ob, into ap, op, &c., of which we shall speak
below, and which may depend upon different considerations, we find
in 7 ACCVMVLAVR ACCIPIO and its tenses are used in early
inscriptions to the exclusion of the harder adcipiffi and occur in
11, 12, 14, 16 quater, 19 quinquies, 20 bis, and also in n. 818 bis and
819; so ACCVSASSE [20]‚ ATINGAT, ATTIGAT, ΑΤΤΙΝ-
GAT, ATTIGERET [12], AVFERATVR [18 bz's], COMVO-
VISSE [10]‚ COMVALEM [13]‚ COMPORTENT [14].

These examples are quite sufficient to disprove the broad asser-
tion that assimilation was unknown until the time of Antoninus Pius,
but on the other hand it is unquestionable that in early inscrip-
tions, in the great majority of cases, prepositions in composition

undergo no change. Thus we have ADFERATVR, ADSIGNARE,
ADSIDVO, ADTRIBVERE, CONLATA, CONLEGA, CONLE-
GIVM, CONLEIBERTVS, CONLOCARE, CONPLVRIBVS,
CONPROMESISE, CONRIGI, DISMOTA, EXDEICENDVM,
INGNOMINIAE, INMITTERE, INMORTALIVM, INPEDITVS,
INPONITO, INPROBARINT, INPROBVM, INPVLSVM, IN-
ROGARE, and others.

In a few cases there seems to have been uncertainty ; thus we find
CONFLOVONT and COMFLVONT both in 13, INPERIVM*
and its cases in 11, 12,’14, IMPERIO [19]‚ INPERARE [14]‚
INPERATO [18], IMPERATOR [20]‚ and uniformly in all

in the spelling of this word and its compounds is dwelt upon and an
explanation suggested—Eu]
