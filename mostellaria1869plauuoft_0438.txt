2 50 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

in Greece sor a day’s work appears from Trin. IV. ii. 1, quoted
above, p. 247.

There is another passage in Plautus which may throw some light
upon the subject; in Men. 111. iii. 17 Erotium's maid says to
Menaechmus, Amabo, mi Illenaechme, inaurez's da mihi Faciundas
pondo duum numum, stalagnukz, ‘ please, Menaechmus dear, give the
jeweller (gold) to the weight of two numi to make for me a pair of
drop-earrings.' Is we suppose that a numus weighed two drachmae,
i. e. about 132 or 133 Troy grains, the quantity here asked sor would
be appropriate, but the ,weight of a libella in silver, say six Troy grains,
would be greatly too small, and the weight of a libella in copper
absurdly large.

It will be observed also that the gold Philippus weighed two Attic
Drachms, and hence the term numus denoting Didrachm was natu-
rally applied to each, the epithet aureus being employed to distinguish
the golden Didrachm from the silver Didrachm.

There is still another consideration which, although hypothetical,
may possibly bear upon this question. No attempt to coin silver
was made at Rome until 269 B.C. When we consider the stormy
and critical character of her history sor nearly a century after that
date, it is not probable that the mint would be very active until the
spoils of Macedonia and Asia were poured into the Treasury. Hence
during the life os Plautus the silver currency must have consisted
chiefly of foreign coins, those in circulation among the Greeks os
Magna Graecia and Sicily. But, judging from the medals which
have come down to modern times, the Didrachm was more common
than any other piece in these regions, and vast numbers have been
preserved belonging to Tarentum, Velia, and Syracuse. These do
not, in most cases, exactly correspond to the weight of the Attic
Didrachm, but Plautus might give the name of numus or numus ar-
genti to the pieces with which he was most familiar.

We may now briefly recapitulato the different propositions which
we have endeavoured to prove.

1. The Numus of Plautus, when the word is used to designate
a particular coin or specific sum, refers to the Greek monetary
system exclusively.

2. When the epithet aureus is added, or distinctly implied, it
denotes the Philippus.

3. When the epithet aureus is not expressed, and not evidently
implied, then the simple numus, sometimes termed numus argenti,
invariably represents a Greek Didrachm os silver.
