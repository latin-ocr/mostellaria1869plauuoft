MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUs. ’ xiii

In v. 36, at the beginning of the line, B has TRA. in red ink from

the old hand. Camer. has erased this, and has written in his own

hand Tr. above, thusjrrl‘n'larus.

vv. 43, 44, and 45, stand in B,

stlagz'zjs oportunus adven advenis
Quid eslf concede huc ditur

Scio te bona ἷε ne
Camer. v. 43, has z're quam and Δ at the end of the line.
v. 44, D. Quin mihi argentum red

v. 45,·he adds at the end of the line clama m'mz's
v. 64 stands in B,

Ferre hoc poles an quo habea! foras
where Camer. has filled up the blank with

mavis ut aliquo.
v. 65 stands in B,

Vrbem exsul hic causa lui,

where Camer. [aster an erasure of parts of two or three words in his
own hand, as if in some other conjecture had occurred to him
first.—ED.] supplies the blank with
linquat factus,
v. 66 stands in B,
Quoi sortem cebz't. DA. Quin non pelo.

Camer. supplies vix dare li [and places a circumssex over quoe.
-En.].

It may be remarked that in these two lines the spaces left are
much larger than would be required for the words supplied by
Camerarius.

At the end of each line, where he has inserted a correction, Camer.
affixes the mark Δ in red ink. There are in other places here and
there a few marks and scratches in the red ink of Camer., but nothing
of any importance.

[The only other insertion in the hand of Camerarius that I was
able to discover, was after the line (v. 78 of same scene),

Quod illuc est finus obsecro quod dle} petil,

where he has written on the margin in the same line, at a short
interval, the words eia mastigia and something like ιίτ. after them,

so ffi-En]
