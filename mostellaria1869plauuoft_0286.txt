1 06 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

58. Nisi te mala re magna mactari capes] The verb macto deserves
particular notice. It seems to be derived from the same root as
mages and magnus, and to be a frequentative form of an obsolete
verb, maga of which the participle mactus remained in use. 1. The
original signification of macto was ‘to magnify,’ ‘to glorify,' in the
sense of paying homage to a deity by offerings or sacrifices, and
thence was applied to men when exalted by honour. In this sense
it is constructed with the accusative of the object to which homage is
paid, and the ablative of the object employed to testify homage.
Thus, Cic. in Vat. VI. ξ 14, Volo ut mihi respondeas . . . quae te tanta
pravitas mentz's tenuerit, qui tantus furor, ut, quum inaudita ac nefaria
sacra susceperis, quum inferorum animas elicere, quum puerorum extis
Deos Manes mactare soleas, &c.; and De Rep. Ι. 43, Eos autem, qui
in magistratu privatorum similes esse velint, eosque privatos, qui efficiant
nequid inter privatum et magistratum .dff⁷rat‚firunt laudibus et mactant
honoribus. So also Enn. Ann. IX. frag. II. ed. Vahlen, Livius inde
redz't magno mactatus triumpho, 2. Hence macto signifies simply, ‘to
offer in sacrifice‚' and is constructed with the accusative of the thing
offered, to which the dative of the object to which the sacrifice is
offered is sometimes added. Examples are very common, e. g.
Lucret. III. 52, Et nzjgras mactant pecudes et Manibus dc'w's In erz'as
mittun& Varro ap. Non. p. 341, Quod Kalendis Iuniis et publice et
privatim savatam pultem Diis mactat,· again, passively, Hor. C. 1. xix. 16,
Alactata veniet lem’or hostia ,· and in Liv. X. 28, Decius exclaims, Iam
ego mecum hostium legiones mactandas Telluri ac Diis Manibus dabo.
3. We now come to that sense which is exemplified in our text, the
sense in which it is used almost invariably by Plautus,*—to magnify
with a bad or ironical force, ‘ to load a person with misfortune,' and
is then constructed with the accusative of the person and the ablative
of the word denoting misfortune. Thus we have in Aul. ΙΙΙ. v. 61,
Dotatae mactant et malo el damno viros ,· and in a fragment of the
Amph„ At ego certe cruce et cruciatu mactabo .· exi, O, foras, mastq'gza.
The expression is very frequently couched in the form of an impre-
cation, e. g. Trin. IV. ii. 151, Ego ob hanc operam argentum accepi:
te macto 2⁰73f0rtum'o; and Bac. IV. viii. 45, Et ego te et ille mactamus
insorlunz'o,· and so Curc. IV. iii. 5, Bac. II. iii. 130, Poen. ΙΙΙ. i. 14.
This use of the word is by no means peculiar to Plautus, for we read
in Ennius (frag. Teleph. V. ed. Vahlen), qui illum dii deaeque magno

* W'e can scarcely consider Rud. Ι. ii. 8 an exception, Si sapiam, hoc,

quod me mactat, concinnem lutum, where mactat means, is ‘tormenting me‚’
is ‘ playing the deuce with me.'
