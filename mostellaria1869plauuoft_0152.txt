cviii PROLEGOMENA.

with the first short, or pronouneed ‘correptim,’ seems to rest upon
Stich. Ι. iii. 60. The following are additional examples from the
index of W.: Merc. Ι. ii. 9 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚ a line which in the
MSS. is corrupt; Men. V. ix. 31, where also the reading is uncer-
tain, but without departing a hair-breadth from the MSS. we have-

Quam lzz‘c tui est, tuque hus‘us aulem ,· postea eandem patriam
ac patrem.

R. has poste, but posg‘ya ean forms a Spondee. The last example
quoted is from Rud. III. iv. 22,

Hae aulem Veneri conplacuerunt—Habeag si argentum dabit,

on which W. has the note, “Hae non elidendum, aulem vero corri-
piendum priori syllaba, quasi Hae ‹7tene.'' It seems positively perverse
to go out of the straight path in search, as it were, of a difficulty.
Elide hae before aulem, and the scansion is simple and obvious.

>Ergo is another of those words in which it is supposed that we
may occasionally pronounce the first syllable short, or the whole
word ‘correptim.' Lind. says, “De ergo correptim pronunciata non
dubitatum est, quamquam rara sunt exempla, veluti Mil. IV. ii. 173⁹
The following are quoted as examples: Mil. IV. ii. 17 (Troch. Tetr.
Cat),

Ego hanc continuo uxorem ducam—Quid ergo hanc dubitas
conloqui ,Ρ

So the MSS„ except that B has Quid ergo hac, which would make
no difference in the scansion. The difficulty here however is not
confined to erg0, but we must make either a Trochee or a Spondee
out of Ego hanc c0n1tz'nuo. R. corrects—

Ego conlz'nuo uxorem hanc ducam—Ergo hanc quid, estc,

Again, quid ergo at the commencement of a Troch. Tetr. Cat.‚
Men. II. iii. 79, occurs in a corrupt passage. Ergo is not found in
any of the best MSS„ and in any case the quid is probably the

word curtailed in the pronunciation. So Trin. IV. ii. 81 (Troch.
Tetr. Cat),

Ne male loquere apsenti amico—Quid ergo ille tgrnavissumus.

So the MSS.; Reiz. and R„ Quid {lle ergo. Pers. I. i. 26 is called
a Troch. Tetr. Cat„ but it cannot be scanned as such without the
omission of a word, and here again we have quid ergo. In Pers. ΙΙ.

ii. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), we have again quid ergo. Stich. V. iv. 45
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),
