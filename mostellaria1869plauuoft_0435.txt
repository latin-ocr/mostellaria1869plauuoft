EXCVRSVS XIV.-TALENT121J, MJA'A, (ἔτ. 247

minae are paid over, two numi are deducted as the value of the bag
(crumena); in Men. Ι. iv. 1 Erotium gives Cylindrus three numi to
purchase viands for a prandz'um,· in Trin. IV. ii. 1 the Sycophanta
says, Huic ego diei nomen trinumofaciam, nam ego operam meam Tribus
numis hodie locavi ad arles nugatorias, with which compare vv. 6, 153.
The passage in Most. ΙΙ. i. 10 will be examined below.

There is nothing in any of the above examples from which we
could with certainty infer the precise value of the Namus. Some
light however is thrown upon the inquiry by the speech of the cook,
in Pseud. III. ii. 20, who complains that when people went to the
market to hire a cook, they looked out not sor the best artiste but
for the cheapest: hence, he exclaims, Hoc ego fui hodie solus opsessor
fori, Illi drachmis * [ssent mzsert', me nemo polest Alt'norz's quisquam
numo† ul surgam subegeroe cf. Aul. III. ii. 34, Pseud. III. ii. 58, 87.
This proves conclusively that the Numus was more in value than the
Drachma. But we can go farther; in Truc. II. iv. 91 Dinarchus
declares that he will expend a Mina on viands for Phronesium,
Praelerea opsonari dumtaxat ad minam, and in vii. 11, Geta, who
had been employed to lay out the money, gives, in a soliloquy, an
account of his stewardship, rejoicing that he had not failed to take
good care of himself, A⁷am iam de lzoc opsonio de mna una deminui
Modo quinque numos, milu' detraxi partem Herculaneam. But the
Pars Herculanea (see note on Most. IV. iii. 45) was a tithe‚ there*
fore five numi were one—tenth of a Alina, and since a Mina=100
Drachmae, five numi must have been equal to 10 Draclzmae, and
hence a qumus was equal to two Draclzmae or a Dz'drachm.

This value of the qumus will suit perfectly the passages quoted
above, and those also in which considerable sums are mentioned.
In Rud. V. iii. 50 Labrax says that he paid a thousand qumz‘ (mille
numos denumeravi) for Ampelisca, but according to the above com-
putation 1000 qumz' would be 20 filinae, which was an ordinary
price for a female slave (see note on Most. I. iii. 142), and so 600
Numi, or 12 Minae, is the price of a female slave of an inferior
description in Pers. I. i. 37, iii. 37, ΙΙΙ. iii. 32, V. ii. 70. Mille
numos is found in Rud. V. ii. 40, where the context proves that the
sum was considerably less than a talent; and mille numum occurs in
Merc. II. iv. 2 3, but here the context does not enable us to fix even
an approximate value for the amount indicated.

* In Merc. IV. iv, 37 a cook demands a drachma as his hire for a day.
† lt is almost unnecessary to observe that the explanation given by some
of the older commentators “ numo aureo Romano ’' is altogether absurd.
