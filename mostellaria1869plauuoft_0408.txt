2 20 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

ego vero quamobrem id facias nescio, ‘why, for that matter, in sooth,
1 do not know why you are doing that.’

Sometimes the qualification introduced by quin is so strong that it
must be translated ⁴ nay, on the contrary :¹ Trin. IV. ii. 87, C. Lubet
audire, nisi molestum est. S. Quin discupio dicere .· here quin refers to
the foregoing molestum—‘ (disagreeable !) nay, on the contrary, Ι am
most eager to tell you;’ Merc. Ι. 43, Egon’ ausim tibi usquam quic-
quam fizcinus falsum proloqui? Quin iam priusquam sim elocutus, scis,
si mentiri volo, ‘do you think it possible that I would dare to tell
you a falsehood? No, on the contrary, before I open my lips, you
know' &c.; Most. 1V. ii. 38 (iii. 15), P. lVam nisi hinc hodie emi-
gravit, aut heri, certo scio Hic habitare. Τ. Quin sex menses iam
hic nemo habitat, ‘why, on the contrary, I tell you‚’ &c.; Merc. ΙΙ.
ii. 54, L. Ad portum propero: nam ibi mihi negotium est. D. Bene
ambulate. L. Bene valeto. D. Bene sit tibi: here Lysimachus quits
the stage and Demipho continues, Quin mihi quoque eliam est ad
portum negotium, qunc adeo ibo illuc: Demipho replies to his own
thoughts as it were, ‘dare any one suppose that Ι am going to remain
here? No, on the contrary, I also have business at the harbour‚
and therefore 1 will now repair thither.'

The use of quin in the following passages may, at first sight, cause
some embarrassment‚ but they may be referred to one or other of
the classes examined above: Stich. IV. ii. 44, G. Quid igilur?
E. Dixi equidem in carcerem ires. G. Quin, iusseris, Eo quoque ibo,
‘well, then,' ‘nay, for that matter,' or simply ‘but, if you give the
order, Ι shall go even thither' (to prison); where quin qualifies eo
quoque ibo. Many editors read si iusseris, but si is not found in the
best MSS„ and is unnecessary, in so far as the construction is con-
cerned, the perfect of the subjunctive being frequently employed to
indicate an hypothesis; thus Iuv. S. III. 77, omnia novit Graeculus
esuriens, in caelum, iusseris, ibit: Trin. II. ii. 60, lVon eo hoc dico quin,
quae tu vis, ego velim et faciam lubens, ‘I do not say this for the
purpose of implying that I am not willing to accommodate myself
to your wishes, and to do cheerfully what you desire,’ where quin is
equivalent to ut n0n; Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 93, the father and son are disputing
about Pasicompsa, Demipho says, Vzginti minzlr, opinor, posse me illam
vendere. C. At ego si velim, iam dantur septem et viginti minae. D. At
ego . . . C. Quin, ego, inquam . . . D. At nescis quid dicturus sim, tace:
quin here marks an eager interruption-Demipho says, ‘But I (would
give).' C. ίΝο, but Ι, Ι tell you, (would give more) ;¹ IV. iv. 25,
D. Palam istaec fiunt, te me odisse. L. Quin nega, ίηο, no, I deny
