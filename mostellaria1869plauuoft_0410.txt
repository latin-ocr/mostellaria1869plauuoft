exhaust the delicate modifications of meaning conveyed by quin, but
enough has been said to guide the student in his investigations.
We may conclude by quoting a passage from the Casina 111. iv.
9, seqq. in which quin is used in a wrangle, and, except in the first
line, where it is equivalent to cur non, must be rendered by ‘ why,
I tell you’ and ‘nay, more than that ε’ A. Quin lu suspendis te.)
[Vempe lule dixeras, Tuam arcessituram esse hinc uxorem meam.
S. Ergo arcessz'w'sse at'l sese, el dixisse te Eam non missurum. A. Quin
ca ipsa ultro milu' A'aegavt'l eius operam se morart'er. S. Quin ea ipsa
me adlegavit, qui lislam arcesserem. A. ‘ Qut'n’ m'hz‘lt' facio. S. Quin me

Quin aliquid aegre filare, quin faciam lubens. A'umquam tibi hodie
‘quin’ ere'l plus quam mz'lu'. Quin hercle di le perdant postremo quidem.

We shall confine our remarks to those uses os this word which,
although not peculiar to the dramatic writers, occur more frequently
in dialogue than in ordinary composition.

The different meanings of 17 may be conveniently arranged under
two heads.

Ι. Vt signisying ‘how‚' ‘as‚' ‘when,' meanings which may easily
be deduced from each other, and may in many cases be represented
by quo modo, or eo modo quo or modum quo, quam, quantum, quanta,
qualis. In this case ul in direct propositions is generally followed
by the indicative mood.

II. Vt signifying ‘that' or ‘in order that.5 This meaning also
may be deduced from ‘how‚’ but the transition is not so obvious.
In this case ul is followed by the subjunctive mood.

I. Vt signisying ‘howss ‘as‚’ ‘when.’

1. Vl, ‘how‚' indicating a simple direct interrogation, as in the
English phrases ‘how does she look?' ‘how are you?’ ‘how goes
it?’ Merc. ΙΙ. iii. 56, D. Sed quis als? ecquam lu advexti luae matri
ancillam Rhodo ,ν’ C. Advext‘. D. Quid? ea ut videtur mulier ,ν’
C. [Van edepol mala. D. Vl morata est ,ν’ C. Nullam vidi melius mea
sententia, ‘what sort of appearance has the woman?’ ‘how does she
look?‘ ‘how is she in disposition?’ or ‘how is she in manners?’
(i.e. ‘is she well-bred?·') so Most. III. ii. 28, Rud. V. ii. 17, ul vales?
‘how are you?' and Truc. II. vii. 2 3, quid agis, uli vales ,ν’ Pers. IV.
iv. 5. ul moenitum muro lz'bt‘ visum esl oppedum ,ν’ Rud. ΙΙ. ii. 6, quid
agilis? ul pcre'lz's? where ul pcrt'lz's is a pleasantry nup* ὑπονοίαν, u!
