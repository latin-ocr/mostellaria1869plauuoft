xlvi PROLEGOMENA.

employed the designation of D paragogz'cum, a term as irrational as
that Of ἐφελκυστικόν in Greek.

It appears chiefly in datives and ablatives‚ but by no means
exclusively‚ and Charisius goes so far as to assert that in ancient
times it was attached to all words ending with a vowel. Thus, in
1 we have GNAIVOD; and in n. 63, 64, DE PRAIDAD; n. 181,
AIRE MOLTATICOD; n. 190, MERITOD; 10 abounds in ex-
amples, such as SENTENTIAD ter, OQVOLTOD, POPLICOD,
PREIVATOD, CONVENTIONID. These are all ablatives‚ but we
have in the same inscription, EAD, acc. pl., EXTRAD, FACILV-
MED, SED for SE (the pronoun), SVPRAD ter. Charisius, p. 87,
specially quotes ted from Plautus, and the forms med and ted occur
repeatedly in the MSS. of the plays. Indeed, some scholars have
imagined that by a free introduction of d at the end of words ending
with a vowel, we might escape srom the embarrassment felt by
metrical scholars on account of the constant recurrence of hiatus.

It is evident however, from our oldest inscriptions, that in the
early part of the sixth century, although the use of the D para-
gogicum had not fallen entirely into disuse. it was not generally
employed, and hence any attempt to introduce it on an extensive
scale into the text of Plautus would be unjustifiable.

Fz‘nal M and Fz‘nal S.

That final m was but faintly pronounced is ew‘dent from the fact
that a final syllable ending in m was elided before a word beginning
with a vowel in all ages of Latin poetry. The same took place
frequently in words ending in uls or is, in the earlier ages of Latin
poetry; the practice was still common in the age of Lucretius, but
afterwards fell into disuse. Hence it is not surprising that, in the
older class of inscriptions, final m is frequently omitted; and the
same holds good, but to a smaller extent, in final s also.

As instances of the dropping of final m we have OMNE(m) [1],
OINO(m)‚ DVONORO(m), OPTVMO (771), VIRO (m), SCIPI-
ONE(m>, CORSICA(m)‚ ALER1A(m)que‚ VRBE(m)‚ AIDE(m)
[3], APICE(721)‚ INSIGNE(m)‚ GREMIV(m) [4], HONORE(m)
[5]‚ ANTIOCO(m) [6]‚ ANNORV(m) [8]. As we advance, the
practice becomes more and more rare, and finally disappears. From

the first, however, it was by no means uniformly observed: thus,
