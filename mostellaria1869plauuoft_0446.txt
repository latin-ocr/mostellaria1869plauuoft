It must not be supposed that these various forms of torture were
by any means confined to male slaves, for women also seem to have
been treated by brutal masters with the same merciless severity.
This will appear from the terms in which Callicles addresses his
ancillae in Truc. IV. iii. 1 seqq, and the cruelty of Roman ladies
to their attendants has been forcibly depieted by Juvenal in his sixth
Satire. There is a curious passage in Terence, Adel. V. iii. 60, where
Demea declares that he will carry off to the country the beautiful
Psaltria, who had fascinated his son, and compel her to perform the
labours of a rustic drudge: M. Modo facito ut illam serves. D. Ego
zlrluc videro: Atque illi firvillae plena, sumi, ac pollinis, Coquendo sit
saxo et molendo : praeter haec Alleridie ipso faciam ul stipulam conligat:
T am excoctam reddam alque otram quam carbo επ,- cf. Mere.11.iii. 78.

Although tortured in a vast variety of ways, slaves were rarely put
to death by their masters, because such vengeance would have
entailed the loss of valuable property. Crucifixion however is fre-
quently spoken os, and is used as a threat‚ or a taum, or a jest:
Most. V. ii. 12 (iii. 12), Non enim ibis: ego strare faxo, ut meruiste,
in crucem ,· Andr. III. v. 15, P. An non dixi hoc esse futurum τ’
D. Dixti. P. Quid meritus ,ν’ D. Crucem; Mil. II. iv. 19, Noli
minitari: scio crucem futuram mihi sepulcrum, Ibi mei maiores sunt
sili: poter, avos, proavos, abavos, Non possunt mihi minaciis· tuis hice
oculi fodiri.

In Mil. ΙΙ. iv. 6 there is an allusion to the practice of making
the criminal carry the cross or gibbet to which he was to be nailed
through the streets to the spot outside the walls where the execution
took place: Credo ego istoc &templo libi esse eundum actutum extra
porlom‚† Dispesst's manibus patibulum quom habebis,- on which a frag-
ment from the lost play of the Carbonariass serves as a commentary,
Patz'bulunzfi·rat per urbem deinde adfigat (ur) cruci.

* XVe talk of α cro-w (bar), the Romans called it an owl. The joke in
geledctet refers to the practice of boys keeping sparrows, owls‚ and other

ir s as pets.

† We are told that this gate was called the Porta Metia on the authority
of Cas. II. vi. 2: CL. Face, Chaline, me certiorem, quid meus ‘m’r me velit.
CH. Ille edepol videre ardentem te extra portam Metiam; and Pseud. Ι. iii. 97,
Iam hic ero: verum extra portam Metiam currendum est prius,· but in both
passages the word Metiam is totally destitute of MS. authority.
