238 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

The student may classify for himself the following examples:
Merc. ΙΙ. ii. 52, Pers. IV. iv. 104, Poen. I. ii. 79, 102, 111. ii. 1,
Rud. IV. ii. 29· 44, Trin. ΙΙ. 1. 31, iv. 112, 154, Eun. ΙΙ. iii. 19, IV.
vi. 18, vii. 29, Heaut. Ι. ii. 38, II. iii. 128, 133, Phor. I. ii. 9.

Sulle's occurs less frequently. In Poen. III. vi. 19 it means ‘if
you like,⁷ without any emphasis; in Stich. I. iii. 67, ‘pray,’ simple
invitation; in Pers. V. ii. 52, agile, sullis, hunc ludtficemus, there is
some eagerness3 in Men. II. ii. 75 it is employed in addressing
slaves; in Stich. I. ii. 8, Rud. III. v. 40, it is addressed to slaves in
an accent of stern command.

Sis is found, although rarely, in the sense of εἰ vis, ‘if you wish,’
as in As. III. iii. 93, Quaeso hercle, Libane, sis lterum tuis saclz's sospi-
tarz', Da mihi istas vzgrl'nlt‘ minam and in the same play, 11. ii. 43, Sis
amanti subvenire familiari filt‘0,· but in the latter passage the punc-
tuation and the arrangement of the speakers in the dialogue are
doubtful.

111. Amabo, it is evident‚ strictly means ‘(if you will do what Ι
ask) Ι shall love you (in return)‚’ and this is fully expressed in Poen.
I. ii. 40, AD. Soror, parce amabo : sal ess istuc allos daz-ere nobis, Ne
nosmet nostra ellam vitia loquamur. ΛΝ. chl'esco. Aa. Ergo amo le .·
compare with this Men. II. iii. 71, Sed scin qus'a‘ te amabo utfacz'ass‘
and Truc. IV. iv. 26, llsullum amabo le ob islam rem, mecastor. Hence
in Phor. I. ii. 4 Amo le may be rendered ‘many thanks‚·’ and so in
Heaut. IV. vi. 21, Deamo te,· and in Phor. III. i. 14, Omnes vos amo.
Cf. Eun. Ι. ii. 106, III. ii. 3.

Amabo occurs very often in Plautus, and is sometimes followed by
an accusative, but is generally without a case. It passes through
the same modifications of meaning as sz's. It is frequently a mere
expression of ordinary civility or simple inquiry‚ ‘ pray, if you please,’
‘have the goodness,’ although a certain degree of earnestness may
be implied: thus Most. I. iii. 10, Contempla, amabo, mea Scapha, satin
haec me vestis deceat fi and in υ. 140, Cedo, attraho, decem,- and II. i. 38,
Tace, amabo, ‘I beg and pray;’ see also I. iv. 29 (30), ΙΙ. ii. 36, Bac.
Ι. i. 19, 28, 67, Cas. ΙΙ. ii. 6, vi. 34, 41, Cist. Ι. i. 19, Cure. I. ii. 18,
Merc. III. i. 5, Pers. II. ii. 63, III. i. 8, Qui, amabo, ‘how so, pray?’
V. ii. 68, Poen. Ι. ii. 31, 189, Eun. Ι. ii. 50, III. iii. 28, 31, IV. iv. 7:
it implies argumentative inquiry‚ Bac. V. ii. 76: anxious inquiry‚ Cist.
II. iii. 22: inquiry and surprise (real or pretended), Bac. V. ii. 3, 30,
Cist. I. i. 18: eager exclamation, wonder, Rud. Ι. iv. 33, Heaut. ΙΙ. iv.
24, Mcrc. III. i. 41: anxiety and alarm, Cist. III. 12, amabo, accurrite,
lt'e se z'nlert'mal, ⁴ in the name of heaven, haste, lest he kill himself ι’
