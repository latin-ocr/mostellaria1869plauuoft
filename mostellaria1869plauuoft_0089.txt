METRE AND PROSODY. liii

and a Trochaic Dipodia. Weise distributes the seventeen lines into
twenty-one, differing toto caelo from both H. and R. Thus, alto-
gether, Weise distributes the forty-two lines, as they stand in B,
into fifty-eight, in the course of which he supposes the measure to
change thirty times. Moreover‚ he is obliged to imagine all sorts
of strange combinations; thus two of the lines are described as
consisting of szod. Cret. cum Chorz'amb0; two more as Cretz'c. monom.
cum Chorz‘ambz's,· another, a single Anapaestus,· another as T rz'spon-
daeus‚· another, Creticus cum amerus& four are T roch. T elram. parlim
pleni, partim Calal. parlim etiam imminuti ,· five are Dimetr. Anap.
cum Iambz‘s. It is hard to see how any one would suppose that any
rhythm whatever could be detected by the nicest ear in such a hete-
rogenous combination‚ where no attempt is made to discover a
system of Strophes and Antistrophes, as in a Greek Chorus. Indeed
it must be evident that any page in a prose author might, without
violence, be cut up into fragments of varying length, each of which
might receive a metrical title.

The same Weise boasts that he has discovered and arranged
upwards of seventy ‘Saturnian Verses' in Plautus, and has ex-
pounded his doctrine fully in a short treatise. But some scholars
have as yet been unable to settle what Saturnian verse really
was, since these so-called Saturnian verses, detected by Weise,
differ widely from each other in structure, without being connected
by any common bond; and since they are, according to his own
admission, altogether distinct from the verses described as Saturnian
by Terentianus Maurus and other ancient grammarians, we feel our-
selves relieved from the necessity of investigating his arguments*

The truth is, however unwilling scholars may be to admit their
own ignorance, that the metrical arrangement of many of the Cantica
is altogether obscure, and they may be regarded as affording
exercises sor the ingenuity of those who love to speculate on such
subjects. Regarded merely as problems of doubtful solution, they
would not be without their use3 but unfortunately many persons
become so wedded to their fancies, and persuade themselves so
firmly of the reality of the visionary children of their imagination,
that they become not only violent and abusive towards those who
venture to express doubts, but scruple not recklessly to mutilate the
text of the poet.

* See the ‘Chapter on Saturnian Verses‘ appended to the author's
‘Manual of Latin Prosody,' Griffin and Co., 1859, in which the whole
subject is carefully and critically discussed.
