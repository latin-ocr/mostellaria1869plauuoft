178 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

generally in eo accessit, ‘to that was added! So eodem may mean
‘to the same place' and ‘to the same person.'

Since co may signify ‘to that place,’ the place may, in certain
cases, be regarded as the extreme point or limit of progression, and
hence, when followed by ut, it frequently signifies ‘to that (such a)
point,’ ‘to that (such a) pitch,’ ‘to that (such an) extent,’ &c.‚ as in
the phrases, urbs eo crevit ut magnitudine laboret sua, ‘the city has
increased to that point,’ or ‘to such an extent;' eo rem adducam ut,
&c.‚ ‘I will bring the matter to that (such a) point ;’ eo furoris
processit, ‘he advanced to that point (such a pitch) of phrenzy‚’ &c.

From the idea of moving or travelling towards a certain place or
point, the transition is easy to the notion of ‘keeping an obJect in
view.’ Hence, figuratively, eo denotes the direction in which the
thoughts or actions move, and hence ‘a purpose, ‘an intention‚’ ‘a
design,' being in this case followed by que, ut, ne, quin, or the like.
This is clearly brought out in the expressions—eo scripsi quo plus
auctoritatis haberem—literas ad te eo misi ut—eo te non interpellavi
ne-—non eo hoc dico quin quae tu vis ego velim etfaciam lubens. So
eodem signifies ‘to the same purpose’ in the phrase eodem pertinere.

ΙΙ. Eo signifying ‘ by that.' When we read in Livy—Nocte et mztte-
bantur et perveniebant .· eo custodias hostium fallebant—eo signifies ‘by
that,' ‘by that mode of procedure‚’ ‘by doing that,' and it serves to
explain a previous statement. Hence eo is frequently equivalent to
‘thus' or hoc modo, ‘for this reason,’ ‘therefore ;’ and when Cicero
says, frater es, eo vereor, eo is explanatory, and means ‘for that
reason‚' ‘therefore ς’ and again, dederam triduo ante literas ad te, eo
ero brevior. So eo when joined with a comparative signifies ‘by that'
in the sense of tanto—eo gravior est dolor, quo culpa maior—and so
eo magis, eo minus, ‘by that (so much) the more,' ‘by that (so much)
the less!

This being premised with regard to eo, it will be found, as might
have been expected, that adeo resembles it very closely in meaning,
indeed, in many caseS, eo might be substituted for adeo and vice versa,
without the sense being perceptibly changed. The different meanings
of adeo may be ranged under three heads.

I. Adeo equivalent to praeterea, and signifying simply ‘in addition
to that.’

11. Adeo signifying ‘up to that point.'

III. Adeo signisying ‘thus,’ ‘in that way,' ‘therefore’

We shall select some of the most striking examples of the
multifarious meanings ascribed by Freund and others to adeo, and
