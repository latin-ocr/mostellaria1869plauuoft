METRE AND PROSODY. lxxxiii

trisyllable (= ηηῖζγὲνῖε) in Most. Ι. iii. 13 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.), where
all the MSS. have,

Non vestem amatores amant mulieris sed vestis fartum.

Pylad„ Bothe, and R. have re-written the line in various ways: I
would Scan it,

Non vestlem amaltores Ι amant ΙΙ nesahzerz’ Ι sed veslti' saritam.

In verbs, Ritschl allows that scio in all its parts, and also nescio, &c.‚
admit synizesis freely; ais and az't may be monosyflatoles, and az‘bam
in all its persons a dissyllable. Such forms as audibam, &c.‚ he
regards as grammatical rather than metrical, and with these excep-
tions he lays down a canon that, in the case of verbs (as in the case
of nouns, with the exception of diu, dies, and trium), the letter i
never forms a synizesis with any vowel following it in the more
regular metres, but only in Octonarians and Anapaests. But we
have an undoubted instance of sarr-zu‘nt in Capt. III. v, 5 (Senar.),

Nam semper occant priusquam sormi rustici,

which R. would attempt violently to get rid of by substituting sariunt,
a form unheard of elsewhere. So ambli-nt, Mil. Ι. 69 (Senar.)‚ where
all the MSS. have,

Molestiae sunt, orant, ambiant, opsecrant.

In the same manner R. vainly endeavours to get rid of eveWt, Trin.
Ι. ii. 33 evenfflt, Most. 11. i. 483 provenffnt v. 67 ; substituting the
forms evenat, evenant, provenant, for what is in each case the reading
of all the MSS. Expolzu—nt occurs Most. Ι. ii. 42.

2. T he letter V. In like manner the character v being employed
to denote a vowel and also a consonant, which, it is probable, had
the sound of the English w, we find tenuia, tenuius, converted into
tenuata, thwz'us, and, without the plea of necessity, genua, curruum,
tenues, &c.‚ become genwa, curwum, tenwes, διε.

Again, without any reference to the exigencies of verse-making,
there was a tendency in the language to drop altogether the v when
it occurred between two vowels, and to contract the vowels into one
syllable3 thus instead of movz’bz'lz's, movimentum, iuvenior, noviler,
providens, we have mobilis, momentum, iunior, nuper, prudens, &c.;
while in verbs the double forms amaverunt, amarunt,· amaveram,
amaram ‚· audivi, audii, and the like, are employed indifferently.

Thus in the dramatists, wherever v is sound between two vowels
