Now Ι would earnestly impress upon the young scholar, that the
belief that we can employ the knowledge which we possess with regard
to the accentuation of Latin words in any way whatsoever so as to
explain or illustrate questions with regard to quantity, is an absolute
delusion, and is moreover a mischievous delusion, because it is not
only erroneous itself but tends to divert us away from a path which,
although intricate, may possibly be threaded, into an inextricable
labyrinth of fanciful conjectures. Although from the language held
in the passage quoted above and adopted by others, we should be
led to suppose that we were handling something real and substantial,
a very few words will suffice to show that in following such researches
we are in reality striving to grasp an airy nothing.

1. Anything which we know with regard to the accentuation of
Latin words is derived from the old grammarians, who state in
the most specific tei-ms that Accent and Quantity are perfectly
distinct.

2. The rules which they give for the determination of the accent†
in each word are founded on the previously ascerlaz'ned quantz'gv of
certain syllables in the word. To determine the position of the
accent therefore from the quantity of certain syllables, and then to
employ the accent as an instrument for determining the quantity of
the same, or of other syllables in the same word, is altogether
illogical, and in many cases amounts to a circular argument.

3. Among much confusion and many discrepancies our ancient
authorities are unanimous upon one point, that the accent in poly-
syllables can fall only on the penultimate and antepenultimate. But
Lindemann is obliged at the very outset to throw this canon over-
board, and to carry back the accent in many words to the fourth
syllable from the end of the word.

4. In reality all the mistakes with regard to this matter have
arisen from the loose manner in which the word “Accent'' is

* But see what Ritschl says on this subject, Prol. p. ccvii.
† NVhen we speak of accent we must be understood to mean the acute
aecem, for it is to this alone that any power is ascribed.
