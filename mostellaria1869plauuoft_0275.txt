NOTES. Ι. i. 4—8. 95

odour. It is applied by Lucretius to the stench proceeding from
a recently extinguished lamp (VI. 792, acris nidor), by virgil to fumi—
gations with galbanum to drive away snakes (G. ΙΙΙ. 415, galbaneo
nidore) and to the burning beard of Ebusus (AEn. XII. 301, nidoremque
ambusta dedit), by Livy to burning seathers (XXXVIII. 7, foedo quodam
nidore ex adusta pluma), by Ovid to the entrails of a vietim consumed
on the altar (Met. XII. 153, Dis acceptus nidor),* and by Pliny to the
fumes of sulphur (XXXV. 15, ξ 50, tanta vis est ut morbos comitiales
deprehendat nidore impositum igni).

6. aedes.] For spelling compare I. i. 77, Periere, et aedis et ager.-
I. ii. 18, Aedes quom extemplo, &c.; 20, Laudant fabrum atque aedes
probant‚· iii. 9, periere hae oppido aedes ,· the MSS. often read edis:
see critical notes throughout.

8. Abi rus, aba· dierecte.] Cf. Cas. Ι. 15, Abi rus, abi dierectus tuam
in provinciam; Most. III. ii. 163, Vbi canis est ,ν’ T. Abi dierecta:
st, abin' binc in malam crucem. Rud. IV. iv. 126, Quin tu i die-
recta cum sucula et cum porculis. That abi dzei‘ecte, abi dierecla,
abi dierectus, i hinc dierectus, abin dierectus, recede hinc dierecte‚
phrases not uncommon in Plautus, are equivalent to abi in malam
crucem, ‘go to the mischies,' ‘be hanged to you,' seems certain,
but the etymology of the word is very doubtful, and it is found in
Plautus only, with the exception of the passage quoted by Nonius
from the Eumenides os Varro. (See below.) The most plausible
explanation is that which represents it as a compound of erigo,
di-erectus, and makes it refer to the outstretched limbs of a malefactor
when hoisted up and nailed on a cross or gibbet. Thus Poen. I. ii.
134, I dierecte in maxumam malam crucem ,· the passage from Most.
III. ii. 163, quoted above; and Capt. III. iv. 103, Quin quiescis
dierectum cor meum J I ac suspende te, Tu supsultas, ego miser vix
asto prae formidine ,· and, as a sort of commentary or illustration, we
may take Mil. ΙΙ. iv. 6, Credo ego istoc exemplo tibi esse eundum actutum
extra portam, Dispessis manibus patibulum quom habebis. When we
read in the Men. ΙΙ. iii. 87 (92), Periit probe Ducit lembum dierectum
navis praedatoria, the expression must mean ‘the piratica] galley is
leading (or towing) the skiff to destruction,’ but in Cure. ΙΙ. i.
21, P. Sed quid tibi est.) C. Lien necat, renes dolent. pulmones

²¹⁶ Since the vapour arisiug from meat while cooked is by no means
necessarily disagreeable, we find Martial VII. xxvii. 5, when speaking of
the roasting of a wild boar, Pinguescant madidi laeto nidore penates, where,
however, several MSS. have madido and laeti, and in any case laetus is
equivalent to the Dis acceptus nidor quoted above.
