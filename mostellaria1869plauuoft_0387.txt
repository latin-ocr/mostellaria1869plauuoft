EXCVRSVS 1V.-—JMO. 201

pessumum In denegando modo quis pudor paululum adest, ‘is it really
true, (you will ask, that there are such persons. Yes, there are, but
bad as these are whom Ι have described, they are not the worst sort
of people:) no, the worst are those who* &c., and then he proceeds
to characterize a class.

III. In certain cases imo may be translated ‘yes,' but this happens
only when imo is used in reply to a negative proposition, and where
‘yes’ is in reality equivalent to ‘on the contrary ;' Aul. ΙΙΙ. vi. 9,
E. lVeque, pol, llfi’gadore, mz'lzz' neque cuiquam pacherz' Opinione melius
res structa est domi. M. Imo est, el Dz'saciant uli siet, &oz here imo
contradicts the negative proposition introduced by neque, ‘yes it is
(i. e. on the contrary, it is, ἃς.) ;“ Bac. II. iii. 81, N. Sed vos nihilne
adtulz'stz's inde auri domum τ’ C. Ima, ellam, verum quanlum adtulerit
nescio: here imo refers to nihil, ‘have you not brought any gold
home from thence?' ‘Yes, we have (i. e. on the contrary, we have),
even now, but how much 1 know not;'' Hec. ΙΙ. i. 31, S. Non mea
opera, neque pol culpa evenit. L. Imo maxume: here imo refers to
non . . . neque, ‘ yes, (i. e. on the contrary) it did, in the highest degree ;'
Adel. ΙΙ. ii. 39, S. qum quid vis quin abeam ‚³ Imo hercle hoc quaeso,
Sure: ‘You don't want anything‚ do you, to hinder me from going
away?' S. ‘Yes‚ (on the contrary, Ι (10 want something> I have to
beg of you’ &c.; Hec. V. iv. 35, Pau. ll'escz's, Parmeno, Quantum
hodie profueris mihi, el ex quanta aerumna extraxeris. PAR. Imo vero
scio .· neque hoc inprudens fici .· ‘You don‘t know.' ‘Yes‚ (on the con-
trary,) Ι do know very well ε’ or we might translate, ‘no, Ι am not
ignorant, I do know well 3' Cas. II. vi. 30, Stalino, Chalinus, and
Olympio are wrangling before proceeding to cast lots: S. Quod
bonum alque fortunatum mz'lzz'sz'l. O. Ila vero el mz'lzz'. C. lVon. O. Imo
hercle. C. Imo mihi hercle. Stalino having prayed that the result
may be fortunate for himself, Olympio adds, ‘be it so, and for me
also,’ upon which Chalinus interposes, ‘no (not for you) ;’ Olympio
retorts‚ with reference to the non of Chalinus, ‘yes, (on the contary‚)
sor me, I say‚' and then Chalinus, ‘no‚ not for you, but for me z’
here, in the same line, we may translate the first imo by ‘yes’ and
the second by ‘no,’ but there is, in reality, no inconsistency, for in
each case imo is employed to contradict the preceding speaker.

In the following passage imo conveys dissent from the form in
which the preceding speaker expresses himself, but assent to the
substance of his proposal; Epid. ΙΙ. ii. 95, E. Vbi erit empta, ul
aliquo ex urbe amoveas: nisi quid lua Secus sententia est. P. luzo, docte.
Epidicus says, ‘this is the plan which I recommend,' and then adds
