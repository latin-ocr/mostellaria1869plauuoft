208 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Quid tute tecum? ‘what's that you’re muttering to yourself?’ Tranio
starts and replies in confusion, Nihil, ‘O nothing, Ι was speaking
sor . . .' and then breaks off abruptly in order, before committing
himself, to ascertain exactly what Theuropides had heard from the
seller. The broken sentences are a mark of confusion and em-
barrassment.

On the same principle we explain Cas. 11. vi. 11. The sortitio
which is to decide the fate of Casina is about to take place in the
presence of Stalino and his wife Cleostrata. Stalino who, sor his own
ends, is eager on behalf of Olympio, says, S. Adpone hic sitellam,
sortes cedo mihi: animum advortite Atque ego censui aps te posse hoc me
inpetrare, uxor mea, Casina ut uxor mihi daretur, et num· etiam censeo.
C. Tibi daretur illa ! S. Mihi enim—ah J id non volui dicere, Dum
mihi volus· huic dixi .· atque adeo dum milti cupio perperam Iamdudum
hercle fabulor. C. Pol tu quidem: atque etiam sacis. Stalino is so
eager and agitated that he becomes thoroughly confused, and un-
awares discloses the real state of his feelings. He begins by saying,
‘I thought, my dear wife, that I might have obtained from you this
favour, that Casina should be made over as a wife to—,' and then
mihi slips out instead of Olflnpioni. On this Cleostrata very naturally
exclaims in wonder, ‘She given to youl’ stanno, carried away by
his excitement, does not at first perceive his blunder, and continues,
‘ yes‚ to me, for—,’ and then, becoming aware of what he had said,
interrupts himself, ‘ no, no, Ι did not mean to say that,' and then, in
his terror, he gets hopelessly involved, and plunges deeper and deeper
at every step. We ought therefore to punctuate, C. Tibi daretur
illa! S. Mihi, enim—ah l id non volui dicere, Dum mihi volui huic
dz'xi, atque adeo dum mihi cupio-perperam Iamdudum, hercle, fabulor,
&c., making another abrupt stop after cupio, where Stalino becomes
Sensible that he is still flonndering, and endeavours to get out by
adding, ‘by Hercules, I have been talking nonsense for some time.’
To this Cleostrata dryly assents, ‘yes, you have been and you are
still talking nonsense!

III. Quia enim. The combination Quia enim seems to be represented
correctly by the idiomatic English phrase ‘for why,’ signifying ‘because ;’
