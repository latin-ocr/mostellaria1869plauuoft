ORTHOGRAPHY. xix Ι

adhuc veteribus ita scriptis libris. Iidem (sc. antiqui) voces quae
pressiore sono eduntur, ausus, causa, fusus, odiosus per duo S scri-
bebant, aussus” etc. Compare further Terent. Scaur. p. 22 57, “Causam
item multis scio per duo S scribi ut non attendentibus hanc literam,
ut etiam cognatam illius R, nisi correpta vocali praecedente, non
solere geminari” etc.

The passage from Velius Longus, pp. 2237, 2238, must be read
carefirlly, but is too long to quote. From it we find, 1. That Nisus
wrote comese and asuese (i. e. apparently comedisse and assuevisse, for
the words are corrupt) with one s, giving two reasons for so doing;
(1) because a consonant cannot be doubled after a long vowel;
(2) because the ‘antiqui’ did not double a consonant at all, but in-
stead of doubling placed a mark over the single consonant. 2. Velius
Longus contradicts Nisus on two grounds; (Ι) the unquestionable
usus of doubling a consonant aster a long vowel in such words as
errasse, saltasse, abiecisse, calcasse,· (2) that there is no real difference
between writing a doubled consonant and placing a mark over it to
point out that it was to be pronounced as doubled. He goes on
to remark that the reason why we write narare with one R is that
it is derived from gnarus.

Again, he questions the propriety of spelling paullum with two Ls,
which was done by some because pullus has two Ls, and then adds,
“ Hic (i. e. the word paullum) autem in longitudine syllabae ante·
cedentis huic literae (i. e. l) obstatur. Est enim (i.e. syllaba an-

tecedens) quarn Graeci dicunt δίφθογγος, iuxta quarn omnino geminari
consonans non potest.''

That the earliest Latins did not double the semivowels is distinctly
asserted also by Quntilian‚ Ι. 7, ξ 14:

“ Semivocales non geminare diu fuit usitatissimi moris;'’ and the
same statement is made repeatedly by Festus, who however extends
the mle to mutes also. Thus, s. V. anus, p. 6, ed. Mun„ he says,
“ antiqui eam literam non geminabant,’' s. ν. aulas, “antiqui . . nullam
literam geminabant ;'’ and again, “ antiqui non geminabant conso-
nantes ;'’ and s.v. solitaurilia, p. 293, he ascribes the practice of
doubling consonants to Ennius, who adopted in this, as in other
things, the Greek fashion.

But if we return to Quintilian, Ι. 7, § 20, we find a passage
specially worthy os notice: “ Quid? quod Ciceronis temporibus, paul-
umque infra fere quoties S litera media vocalium longarum vel
subiecta longis esset, geminabatur? ut caussae, cassus, dz'vissiones, quo-

modo et ipsum (et) Virgilium (μιοὲιιε scripsisse, manus eorum docent.
