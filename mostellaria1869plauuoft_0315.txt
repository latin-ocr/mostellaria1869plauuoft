NOTES. I. iii. 104—107. 133

quod gestum non esset,· tollendo quod esset, et semper aliquid demendo,
mutando, interpolando. In the passage before us interpolare may be
translated ‘you seek to beautify a most charming work of art by
daubing it over with (i.e. by the addition of) fresh colours.’ See also
Plin. H. N. XXXV. 16, ξ 56, Est z'n medicaminibus et Clzz'a terra can-
dicans, effictus eiusdem, qui Samiae. Vsus ad mulierum maxime cutem .-
z'dem et Selinusiae. Laclez' coloris est llaec et aqua dilui celerrima .-
eadem lacte diluta tectoriorum albaria interpolantur, i. e. ‘ the white
plaster on walls is renovated' (by the addition of this whitewash).
See also Q. Curt. VI. 2, ᾧ 5, speaking of Alexander, Igitur quum
intempeslz'vz‘s conviviis dies pariter noctesque consumeret, satietatem epu-
larum ludis interpolabat, i. e. ‘ diversified by the introduction of.' See
also IV. 6, ᾧ 28, where the reading is doubtful. Below, Ι. iii. 117, we
have the adjective z’nterpoles‚ i. e. ‘ painted Jezebels,' a word which
occurs only in this passage and twice in Pliny: H. N. XIX. 2, ξ 8,
speaking of spartum, so extensively used for cordage, he remarks,
Est quidem eius natura z'nlerpolz's, rursusque quam libeat vetustum novo
miscetur, i. e. ‘is susceptible of renovation‚' i. e. as explained by what
follows, ‘the old fibre may be worked up again with new to any
extent without injuring the quality of the product.' Again, H. N.
XXIX. 1, ξ 5, speaking of medicine, lllulalur ars quolz'dz'e totiens z'n-
terpolz's el ingeniorum Graeciae flatu impellimur, i. e. ‘ changing its
aspect daily.’ Holland thus paraphrases the expression, ‘Thus you
see how often this art from time to time hath been altered, and daily
still it is turned like a garment new dressed,’ &c.

107. [Uelinum] sc. pigmentum, a fine white earth, named from
the island of Melos in which it was found. Plin. H. N. XXXV. 6,
ξ 19, Alselz'num candidum el ipsum est, optumum in Melo insula ,· z'n
Samo quoque nascitur: eo non ulunlur pictores propter nimiam pingui-
tudinem,·* accubantes effodzunt ibi z'nler saxa venam scrutanles. It was
used also as a medicine. (Plin. 1. c.) The young student must be
careful to distinguish this adjective from another the quantity and
spelling of which are the same, viz. melinus, derived from μῆλον, an
apple or quince.† It is used by Plautus to denote some colour,

* And yet he tells us that melinum was one of the four colours used
exclusively by Apelles, Echion, Melanthius, and Nicomachus, the others
being lamp-black (atramentum), the red of Sinope, and the yellow ochre
(sil) of Athens. Plin. H. N. XXXV. 6, ξ 32.

† In Plin. H.N. XXIII. 6, ᾧ 54,fit et oleum ex his, quod melinum voca-
vimus, and in XIII. 1, ᾧ 2, we have melinum denoting a perfume (unguentum)
particularly valued in Cos; and lower down he gives the mode in which it
was compounded by the admixture of various substances with melinum oleum.
