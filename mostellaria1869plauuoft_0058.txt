xxviii PROLEGOMENA.

RENT, IOVRATO, and IVRATO‚ IVRARIT.

The case of long ι’ deserves particular consideration. We find
a multitude of examples from the earliest inscriptions downwards,
in which it is represented by ei, and this both in terminations and
roots. Thus, VIRTVTEI, QVEI [l]‚ QVEI, GESISTEI,
SEI [4], QVOIEI, VIRTVTEI, QVEI [5], PETIEI, SIBEI
[7]‚ QVEI, FOIDERATEI, EXDEICENDVM, NEIQVIS,
SEI, QVE1‚ SIBEI, DEICERENT, VTEI, VBEI, IBEI,
CEIVIS, NISEI, OINVORSEI VIREI, NISEI, INCEIDERE-
TIS, PREIVATOD [10].

But this mode of representing long z' was not observed with
anything approaching to uniformity even in our most ancient
authorities: thus, AIDILIS [1], AIDILES, AIDILIS, BAR-
BATI [3], PVBLI, CORNELI [4]‚ ACCVMVLAVI, GENVI,
OPTENVI [7]‚ but in the same inscription PETIEI [7]‚
VENIRENT, AVDITA, VRBANI, COVENTIONID, SACRI
[10].

The absolute uncertainty which prevailed upon this point is proved
by the Lex Thoria, in which we find not only FRVEI and FRVI,
HEREDEI and HEREDI, DEICITO and EDICITO, AGREI and
AGRI, both in the genitive, but such combinations as POPVLEI
ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMAN1; AGREI
LOCEI, AGRI LOCEI, AGRI LOCI ; POPVLI LEIBEREI,
and many others*

This uncertainty seems to have disturbed literary men, for Lucilius
endeavoured to lay down rules which might determine the cases in
which ez' should be employed to denote the long vowel, and those
in which the simple z' should be used. Quintilian,† Velius Longus‚‡
and Terentius Scaurus& all refer to the principles which he sought
to establish‚ and quote his words, but the passages are so obscure
and corrupt that it is very difficult to ascertain what his views really
were. It would seem that in nouns of the second declension he
wished to distinguish the numbers by writing pueri, viri in the
genitive singular and puerei, virez' in the nominative plural, while in
nouns of the third declension he wrote ei in the dative singular, as
