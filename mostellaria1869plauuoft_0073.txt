reforms, proposed to introduce a new character into the Latin
alphabet‚ the Antisigma )(‚ which might serve as the representative
of ψ. See especially Priscian, pp. 557, 566; Vel. Long. pp. 2224,
22 33; Terent. Scaur. pp. 2252, 2261; Curt. Valerian. ap. Cassiodor.

Before quitting this subject, we may notice that the preposition ab,
occasionally‚ although rarely, appears under the form of qs: thus in
15, AF VOBIS; in the Polla inscription, AF CAPVA, but in the
same, AB REGIO; n. 1143, AF MVRO; n. 1161, AF SOLO;
see also nn. 551, 587, which are less satisfactory.

Words ending z'n D.

Ten Latin words end with the letter d—-Ad‚ Aliud, Apud, Haud,
Id, Illud, Istud, Quid, Quod, Sed. It seems certain that, in later
times at least, the sound of d in these words could not be distin-
guished from that of l, and that, in writing them, l was frequently
substituted for d. Thus Quintil. Ι. O. I. vii. 5, “Illa quoque servata
est a multis differentia, ut ad, quum esset praepositio, D literam, .
quum autem coniunctio, T acciperet.'' These words clearly indicate
that, whichever letter was employed, the sound must have been the
same, and seems to imply that many persons, and probably Quin-
tilian himself, employed d and l indifferently in writing the words
in question.

In the testimony of the later grammarians, fact and opinion, theory
and practice, are, as is usual with them, mixed up together. Terent.
Δ Scaurus (p. 2250) considers it a mistake to write the preposition

with a t, or the conjunction with a d, proving that the interchange
was not uncommon. Velius Longus (pp. 2230, 2287) tells us that
to avoid confusion we ought to write the preposition ad and the
pronouns id, quid, quod, all with a d, in order to distinguish them
from the conjunction at, the verbs it and quit, and the adverb quot,-
he maintains that apud ought to be written with a d, because no pre-
position ends with t, and because it sounds better “propter nimiam
T literae exilitatem.’' On the other hand, he holds that sed ought
to be written with a t, because no conjunction ends with d, but admits
that in pronunciation the sound of the final letter was that of d rather
than of t, and that therefore the question was whether we should
write it as it was pronounced, or pronounce it as it was written.

In direct opposition to this, Charisius (p. 87), Scaurus (p. 2251),
