have anticipated from the close, natural relation which subsists be-
tween these two labial mutes, in virtue of which they are constantly
interchanged, not only in cognate languages but in different dialects
of the same language, and even in different parts of the same word
in the same dialect, as, for instance, in nubo, nupsz',· scribo, scrip5i;
labor, lapsus, and the like. The only Latin words which end in b
are the prepositions ab, ob, sub. The connection of two of these
with ἀπό and ὑπό is obvious, and although no trustworthy examples
of ap, op, or sup are supplied by inscriptions, it is certain that they
frequently took this sound in composition when prefixed to words
commencing with s or t.

Thus Quintil. I. O. I. vii. 7: “Quaeri solet, in scribendo
praepositiones, sonum, quem iunctae efficiunt, an, quem separatae,
observare conveniat; ut quum dico obtinuit, secundam enim B
literam ratio poscit, aures magis audiunt P.’'

As might have been expected, in the earlier forms of the language
the ear exercised greater influence than etymological considerations‚
and we find in the inscriptions which we have enumerated above,
ap, op, and sup, for ab, ob, sub, when these prepositions are corn-
pounded with words beginning with s or t. Thus APSOLVTVS
[12 bz's], OPSIDES [1], OPSIGNETVR [12]‚ OPTINENT [17],
OPTINEBIT [12‚ 14, 16 bz's], OPTENVI [7]‚ SVPSIGNET,
SVPSIGNENT‚ SVPSIGNATO, SVPSIG (netur), SVPSIGNA-
TVM, SVPSIAVO [14]. These instances are not very numerous,
but they are all in the same direcfion, and we find no example of
any of these prepositions retaining its proper shape before s or t
until we reach 19, B.C. 49, which contains ABSOLVITO thrice;
and 20, B.C. 45, which has OPTEMPERETVR, and therefore we
may feel justified in assuming that the practice prevailed during the
age of Plautus and long afterwards. We may safely extend the rule
to those cases in which the preposition abs enters into composition,
for we find in inscriptions of a comparatively 'late date such forms
as APSTINERE, APSTINENTI, APSTVLIT, APSTVLERIT‚
APSENS, APSENTI.

Numerous passages are to be found in the old grammarians
bearing upon the relation subsisting between bs, ps, and the Greek
ψ, the sound of the latter not being accurately represented by either
of the two former‚* so that Claudius, among other grammatical

³²< Thus Priscian, p. 557, “multo molliorem et volubiliorem sonum

habet ψ quam ps vel bs . . . sicut ergo ψ melius sonat (quam ps vel bs)
sic x etiam quam gs vel cs: et x quidem assumpsimus, ψ autem non.”
