EXCVRSVS XIV.-TALENTVM' MJNA, ‹L-c. 243

the Latin dramatists,* and also Talentum magnum argentz‘,† proved for
a considerable period a source of embarrassment to scholars until
Gronovius (De pecun. vet.) demonstrated that these terms, like the
simple Talentum or Talentum argenti, denoted the ordinary Attic
Talent,‡ and that the epithet magnum was occasionally employed by
the Roman writers, for by them only is it used, because they first
became acquainted with the word Talentum in their intercourse
w'ith the Greeks of Sicily and of some cities of Magna Graecia,
who, like the old Ralians, had adopted copper as the standard of
their currency, and whose money Talent was therefore a Talent
of copper, and equivalent to a very small sum. Hence when the
Romans, at a subsequent period, first became acquainted with the
Attic Talent, they would naturally seek to distinguish it from the
small Sicilian talent by attaching to it the epithet magnum.§

In like manner as Talentum and Talentum argenti are used indif-
ferenssy, so are Minae ΙΙ and Argenti mz'naefll and likewise Drachmae
and Brachmae argenti s. argenteae.** When in one passage, Truc.
V. 8, we read, Ego, mea voluptas, si quid peccavi prius, Subplz'cz'um aa'
te hanc minam fero auri, we must understand minam auri to signify
not ‘ a pound of gold’ but ‘the value of a Mina, or pound of silver,
in gold.'

We have said that wherever mention is made of Greek money in
the Latin dramatists we must refer it to the Attic standard. To this
there is one exception, where however the distinction is carefully
marked, Trin. II. iv. 23, Trapezz'tae mille drachumarum Olumpicum,
Quas de ratione dehz'buz'stz‘, redditae. What these Olympic Drachmas
may have been we cannot tell, for, as far as I am aware, they are
not named in any other passage in the Classics.

'³¹‘ E. g. Aul. IV. ii. 30, Cist. 11. iii. 19, Cure. 1. i. 64, Rud. 111. iv, 73,
V. ii. 43, Phor. IV. iii. 39.

† Most. 111. iii. 10 (IV. ii. 10), Rud. V. ii. 57. iii. 19, 24.

‡ lt will be seen, by referring to Rud. V. ii. 43, 45, 57, V. iii. 19, 24,
that Talentum, ‘Talentum magnum, ‘Talentum argenti magnum, designate the
same sum.

§ Ι am aware that this explanation of the meaning of ‘Talentum magnum
has been controverted, but Ι believe that it is generally accepted by the
best scholars and numismatologists. The subject has been discussed by
Bentley, with his usual acuteness‚ in the chapter on Sicilian Money in his
Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris.
