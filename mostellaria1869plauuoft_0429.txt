Adel. IV. ii. 11, ν. 63, Andr. IV. iii. 6, V. iv, 52, Eun. IV. iv. 18,
Heaut. Π. iii. 26, 98, Phor. ΙΙ. ii. 5, ΙΙΙ. iii. 20: coaxing‚ Truc. V.
57, Eun. I. ii. 15: wonder, impatience‚ contempt, Adel. IV. v. 21, 27,
Andr. IV. iii. 10, iv. 8, Eun. IV. iv. 12, Hec. IV. i. 41, Phor. Ι. iv. 19,
Poen. I. ii. 122, V. iv. 22. It will be seen from the above examples
that obsecra like amabo, is not unfrequently followed by the accu-
sative of the person appealed to, but more frequently does not take
a case, and is in many instances a mere exclamation. In Heaut.
IV. i. 31 it is construed with a double accusative, Mi Chreme, peccavi,
faleor, vincor, nunc hoc le opsecr0,· and in Pers. I. i. 49 the entreaty is
strengthened by the addition of resecro—Opsecro le, reffero, operam da
hanc mihi fidelem.

Perhaps it is scarcely worth remarking that while amabo recurs
again and again in Plautus, obsecro is found in comparatively few
passages, while Terence evinces a decided preference for obsecro over
amabas quaeso is more common, in propordon, in Plautus than in
Terence ς sodes is used upwards of a dozen times in the six plays of
Terence, and not more than five or six times in the twenty plays
of Plautus. Sullz's does not occur in Terence; it is quoted by Festus
(pp. 301, 343, ed. Mun.) from Plautus, Cato, and Ennius.

XIV.—TERMS EMPLOYED WITH REFERENCE TO
MONEY.

TALENTVM, MJNA‚ DRACHMA, OBOL VS, PHILIPPVS
s. NVMVS PHILIPPEVS, NVMVS s. NVMVS
ARGENTJ.

Ι. Talentum, Mina, Drachma, obolus. As might be expected,
considering the source from which the works of Plautus and Terence
are derived, the sums of money mentioned in their plays are, for
the most part, calculated according to the Greek system of Talents,
Minae, and Drachmae.

We may remind the young scholar that these terms all denoted
certain weights, and that although the absolute value of each differed
in different states, their mutual relation was invariable. Mina may
be represented in all cases by the English word Pound, but as the
Avoirdupois Pound differs from the Troyes Pound, and both from
the Italian Pound, so the Mina of Athens was different in absolute

weight from the Mina of AEgina, and both differed from the Mina
