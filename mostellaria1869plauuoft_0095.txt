METRE AND PROSODY. lix

Nay, examples such as the following, if genuine, would go to prove
that a whole Tetrameter might be made up of Molossi alone :—
Amph. ΙΙ. ii. 20,

Et patria el* prognati, tutantur, servantur.
and Poen. Ι. ii. 9,
Postquam aurora illuxit, numquam concessamus.†

In addition to the Bacchius and the Molossus this verse permits
of the resolution of the first syllable of the Molossus, and thus the
Ionie a minore (υ υ --) finds a place, but is used much more
sparingly than either the Bacchius or the Molossus:—

In 1st‚

M &rzto Ιιόι· ηόὖιζς fil qui quidem huc venerimus.

In 2nd‚

Soror, cotha, ᾶηιᾶόῡ, item nos perhiberi.

In ΒΥΦ Quamquam haud falsa sum nos ὄᾶἷὸεᾶε haberi
Nam mullum loquaces 7)ιένῖίο omnes habemus.
In 4th,

Tun me, verbero, audes herum luffficdri.

Lastly, either of the long syllables of the Bacchius may be resolved,
and then we shall obtain the fourth Paeon (υ υ υ -) and the second
Paeon (υ - υ υ) as feet available in any place except the 4th,
from which the second Paeon is excluded : thus—

Quam sz' salch maricitica esse autumanlur.
lVeque eis ulla ornandi settis sdtletas est.
Novarum aedium esse arbitr5r sZmilem &go hominem.

According to what has been said above the scheme of the Bacchiae
Tetrameter will be as follows :—

υ-- Ι υ-- Ι υ-- Ι υ--
υυ--Ιυυ--Ιυυ--Ιυυ--
υυυ-Ιυυυ-Ιυυυ-Ιυυυ-
υ-υυΙυ-υυΙυ-υυι 'ss

* To be scanned Et patry’ et.

† So Hermann, but the text is very doubtful.

‡ This is the doctrine of Hermann, which has generally been adopted
by metrical scholars, but l have serious doubts as to the admissibility of
the fourth and second Paeon. In the first of the examplcs given above,
ηιῠνῑᾶιὶεα might be pronounced mstryffca, and this actually takes place
some lines lower down—so, sfftwtas may become scitye‘tas‚ szmrlem may

become salem, and hesmznem may be hffr‘nnem.
